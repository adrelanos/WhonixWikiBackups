&lt;!--T:3--&gt;
Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en&lt;/ref&gt;, Debian GNU/Linux&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian&lt;/ref&gt; and security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP.
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:4--&gt;
Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:5--&gt;
To learn more about security and anonymity under Whonix, please continue to the [[About|About Whonix]] page.

|description=Whoniy Summary, what who is, Anonymity online through Tor, Security by Isolation, Based on Debian
}}
{{Header}}
= Introduction =
Whonix aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity by helping you use your applications anonymously. A [[Tor Browser|web browser]], [[XChat|IRC client]], word processor, and more come pre-configured with security in mind.

It is a complete operating system&lt;ref&gt;Which consists of two virtual machines: Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation&lt;/ref&gt; designed to be used inside a host operating system&lt;ref&gt;Such as your currently installed OS on your computer or an OS installed on an external drive.&lt;/ref&gt;. It is Free Software and based on Tor&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en&lt;/ref&gt;, Debian GNU/Linux&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian&lt;/ref&gt; and security by isolation.

= Security by Isolation =

Whonix is divided into two parts: &lt;u&gt;Whonix-Workstation&lt;/u&gt; for your work and &lt;u&gt;Whonix-Gateway&lt;/u&gt; for automatically routing all internet traffic through Tor. This is security by isolation, and it averts many threats posed by malware, misbehaving applications, and user error. 

= Anonymity online through Tor =

Whonix relies on the Tor network to protect your anonymity online: all connections are either forced through it or blocked. Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world. Anybody watching your Internet connection can't see what sites you visit, and the sites you visit can't learn your physical location.

To learn more about Tor, see the official [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor website]:

* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#whyweneedtor Tor overview: Why we need Tor]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#thesolution Tor overview: How does Tor work]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en Who uses Tor?]

= Based on Debian =

To oversimplify it: Whonix is just a collection of configuration files and scripts.

This isn't a stripped down version of Debian. For example, anything you can do with &quot;vanilla&quot; Debian GNU/Linux, you can do with Whonix. Likewise, most problems and questions can be solved in the same way. For example: &quot;How do I install xrandr on Whonix?&quot; -- &quot;The same way you would with Debian {{Code|apt-get install xrandr}}&quot;. Whonix doesn't break anything and doesn't stop you from using anything you want.

|description=Whonix Feature List
}}
{{Header}}

= Whonix Features =
Whonix is an Anonymous Operating System. It hides your IP/location and uses Tor to anonymize your data traffic. This means that neither the contacted server, nor any eavesdropper on your connections, nor the operators of the Tor network themselves can realize which webservice you use.

To learn about its differences, check the [[Comparison with Others]].

Basically any program can be used together with Whonix:

* For web browsing, [[Tor Browser]] is included.
* Messengers, like Pidgin, with the Jabber protocol and the OTR plugin.
* Privacy friendly e-mail client: [[Email#Mozilla_Thunderbird_with_TorBirdy|Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy]]
* scp for secure data transfer from and to a server.
* Unobserved administration of servers via SSH
* Web servers: Apache, ngnix, IRC servers, etc. via [[Hidden Services]]
* Other programs...

It is possible, with the help of Whonix, to use applications via Tor, which are not capable of proxy support by themselves.

Everything is explained in [[Documentation]].

= Feature List =
* [[Browser_Plugins#How_to_use_Flash_-_EASY|Adobe Flash]] anonymously
* Browse The Web Anonymously
* Anonymous [[XChat|IRC]]
* Anonymous Publishing

= Advantages of Whonix =
* All applications, including those, which do not support proxy settings, will automatically be routed through Tor.&lt;ref&gt;{{note}} For application warnings, see [[Documentation]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{note}} IPv6 is not yet supported by Tor. Limited workaround: [[OnionCat]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{note}} UDP is not supported by Tor, thus will not work in Whonix as well.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7830 UDP is not supported by Tor]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Limited workaround: [[OnionCat]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{note}} Services that need to listen on publicly reachable ports (open/forwarded ports) are also not supported. However you may run [[Hidden Services]] which are reachable via Tor or tor2web ([https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/tor2web be careful]).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Installation of any software package possible. &lt;ref&gt;{{note}} Must be able to run on Debian GNU/Linux or you can use [[Other Operating Systems]]. See also [[Install Software|Software installation on Whonix-Workstation]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{note}} ICMP, ping, VOIP calls over UDP, etc...&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{note}} Skype over TCP does work, but it's not recommended, because it's proprietary, closed source and there is no control over the encryption keys. Skype authority can compromise you out any moment. A secure encryption/authentication design looks different. For example GPG and OTR are secure, because the user has control over the keys, not the server. See [[Voip#...|Voip Skype section]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{note}} [[OnionCat]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{note}} [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Safe hosting of [[Hidden Services]] possible. &lt;ref&gt;{{note}} Even if someone hacks your hidden server software (lighttpd, thttpd, apache, etc.), he can not steal your hidden service key. The key is stored on the Whonix-Gateway. Once you cleaned your Whonix-Workstation, no one can impersonate your hidden service anymore.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{note}} The Workstation is the place where the browser, IRC client and so on is running. The Gateway is the place where Tor and the firewall is running.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Protection against side channel attacks, no IP or DNS leaks possible. &lt;ref&gt;{{note}} Whonix protects against IP and DNS leaks. Other possible leaks (such as username; time zone; etc.) and how to mitigate them see [[Documentation]]. Additionally Whonix's [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]] mitigates many possible fingerprinting attacks by using common, non-identifying defaults. (username set to user; timezone set to UTC; etc.) &lt;/ref&gt;
* Advantage over Live CD's: Tor's data directory is still available after reboot, due to persistent storage. Tor requires persistent storage to save its Entry Guards &lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Java / JavaScript &lt;ref&gt;{{note}} There is no difference compared to using JavaScript directly within the Tor Browser Bundle.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Of course JavaScript within TBB inside Whonix will also not leak your IP. Browser fingerprinting still applies. For more information see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers Web-browser]!&lt;/ref&gt; / flash / [[Browser Plugins]] &lt;ref&gt;{{note}} This is still not recommended as they may decrease anonymity (e.g. flash cookies) and often have security vulnerabilities. Most popular plugins are closed source. See [[Browser Plugins]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; / misconfigured applications cannot leak your real external IP. See [[Security in Real World]].
* Protection against IP/location discovery through root exploits (Malware &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware&lt;/ref&gt; with root rights) inside Whonix-Workstation. But you should really not test it &lt;ref&gt;{{note}} In case Whonix-Workstation gets rooted, the adversary can not find out the users real IP/location. This is because Whonix-Workstation can only connect through the Whonix-Gateway. How difficult is it to compromise Whonix? See [[Comparison with Others#Attacks|Attack Comparison Matrix]] and [[Design]]. More skill is required.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Uses only Free Software &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Building Whonix from source is easy, see [[Dev/Build Documentation]].
* Tor &lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org&lt;/ref&gt; + Vidalia &lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html.en&lt;/ref&gt; and Tor Browser &lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en&lt;/ref&gt; are not running inside the same machine. That means that for example an exploit in the browser can't affect the integrity of the Tor process. &lt;ref&gt;{{note}} [[Vidalia]] is optional; [[Tor Controller|arm]] is installed as alternative.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is possible to use Whonix in conjunction with VPNs, ssh and other proxies. But see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor plus VPN/proxies Warning]. Everything possible, as first chain or last chain, or both.
* Loads of [[Features#Whonix Features|Features]].
* Loads of Optional Configurations (additional features / Add-Ons) available.
* Best possible [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Private obfuscated [[Bridges]] can be added to {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.
* Whonix-Gateway can also torify Windows, see [[Other Operating Systems]].

= Disadvantages of Whonix =
* More difficult to set up compared to the regular Tor Browser Bundle.
* Needs virtual machines or spare hardware.
* Updating OS and applications behind the Tor proxy is slow.
* Higher maintenance required. &lt;ref&gt;{{note}} You need to maintain three instead of one OS. You need to remember several passwords and update at least three systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|VPN and Tunnel Support}}

= VPN / Tunnel support =
All kinds of tunnels is possible and tested. Route something through Tor; or route through something before connecting to Tor; or both.

* Tunnel Support
** [[Tunnel_Tor_through_proxy_or_VPN_or_SSH|Tunnel Tor through proxy, VPN or SSH (user -&gt; proxy/VPN/SSH -&gt; Tor)]]

** And if you want to combine both methods...
*** user -&gt; Proxy/SSH/VPN -&gt; Tor -&gt; Proxy/SSH/VPN
*** is possible as well.
** [[TestVPN|Free Example VPNs working with Whonix for testing purposes]]

Replacing Tor with something is possible as well, although only for some combinations and networks. It's partially done but don't hold your breath for seeing those features finished, see [[Other Anonymizing Networks]].

Whonix virtual machine images are cryptographically signed using OpenPGP&lt;ref&gt;OpenPGP is a standard for data encryption that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication through the use of keys owned by its users.&lt;/ref&gt; by Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer.

&lt;!--T:21--&gt;
If you know how to use an OpenPGP key, download the [[Whonix Signing Key|Whonix Signing Key]] and the [[#Download Whonix|Whonix signatures]] straight away.

&lt;translate&gt;== Introduction == &lt;!--T:221--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;
&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:37--&gt;
Reading the latest news is important to stay on top of latest developments. Should security vulnerabilities ever be found in Whonix or should an improved version be released, you should be informed.
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;== Whonix News Blogs == &lt;!--T:222--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;
[[File:Whonix News Blog opened offline created by adrelanos.png|thumb|alt=&lt;translate&gt;Whonix News Blogs Screenshot&lt;/translate&gt;|&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:223--&gt;
Whonix News Blogs&lt;/translate&gt;]]
&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:224--&gt;
There are two ways to get news. Choose at your preference.&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:39--&gt;
# [https://anonymousoperatingsystem.wordpress.com/category/important/ Whonix Important Blog] - Most important stuff only. Security vulnerabilities and new stable versions only. For people with very limited time and interest in Whonix development and news.
# [https://anonymousoperatingsystem.wordpress.com/ Whonix Feature Blog] - Includes everything from Whonix Important Blog. Also testers-only and developers versions are announced. Has a relaxed posting policy. Also blog posts about updated articles, new features, future features, development, call for testing, general project thoughts and so on will be published.
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:40--&gt;
When you start '''Tor Browser Recommended''', there is a shortcut on the desktop, see&lt;/translate&gt; [[Image:important.png|alt=&lt;translate&gt;Tor Browser Recommend Icon&lt;/translate&gt;|r]] &lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:225--&gt;
, it will open both Whonix News Blogs in a privacy friendly way. It's recommended at least to read Whonix Important Blog if you are in a hurry. Have a look into Whonix Feature Blog if you are generally interested to learn about anonymity/privacy/security related things or to see what's going on with Whonix.
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;== Operating System Updates == &lt;!--T:226--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;
&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:42--&gt;
You should regularly check for operating system updates on your host operating system, on Whonix-Workstation and on Whonix-Gateway as highly recommended in the [[Security Guide|Security Guide]].
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;== Tor Browser == &lt;!--T:227--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;
[[Image:whonixcheck_gui.png|alt=&lt;translate&gt;whonixcheck graphical user interface screenshot&lt;/translate&gt;|[[whonixcheck|&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:228--&gt;
whonixcheck&lt;/translate&gt;]]|thumb]]

&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:45--&gt;
There is no auto-update feature for Tor Browser. You will be notified about new Tor Browser versions by [[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]]. Tor Browser's built in update check mechanism also works in Whonix. For instructions how to update the browser, see [[Tor Browser|Tor Browser]]. Additionally it might also be wise to subscribe to https://blog.torproject.org for news.&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;== Whonix Version Check and Whonix News == &lt;!--T:229--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;
[[File:whonixcheck created by adrelanos.png|alt=&lt;translate&gt;whonixcheck graphical user interface screnshot&lt;/translate&gt;|thumb|&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:230--&gt;
Whonix Version Check (first rectangle in black) and&lt;/translate&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:231--&gt;
Whonix News&lt;/translate&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:232--&gt;
(second rectangle in green)&lt;/translate&gt;]]
&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:233--&gt;
Furthermore you will be automatically notified about new Whonix versions by Whonix Version Check and about the most important occurrences&lt;/translate&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:234--&gt;
Such as when a version becomes unsupported, if manual action is required, if major features break, or if security vulnerabilities are found. The policy is to use Whonix News as rarely as possible.&lt;/translate&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:235--&gt;
by Whonix News, both of which are part of [[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]].&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;== Social Media Profiles == &lt;!--T:236--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;
&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:48--&gt;
There are some [[Official Whonix Online Profiles|Whonix Social Media Profiles]], but please don't rely on them for getting Whonix News and please don't use them to contact Whonix developers. (See [[Contact|Contact]] for contact information.)
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:49--&gt;
Because some people will do so even though it is not recommended, messages from the Whonix Feature Blog will be automatically mirrored to [https://twitter.com/Whonix Whonix Twitter Profile], to [https://www.facebook.com/Whonix Whonix Facebook Profile] and to [https://plus.google.com/108150429836421683225/ Whonix Google+ Profile].
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:52--&gt;
If you won't get into trouble by letting others learn about Whonix, feel free to follow or like those profiles (with your anonymous account) as a little way to [[Contribute|Contribute]].
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;== Source Code == &lt;!--T:237--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;
&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:54--&gt;
In case you are interested in Whonix source code updates, [[Dev/git#subscribe_to_code_changes|subscribe to code changes]].
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;= Known bugs = &lt;!--T:238--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;== Normal == &lt;!--T:239--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;=== Mounting (CD/DVD) Devices === &lt;!--T:240--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;
&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:241--&gt;
You can use the following workaround.&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom/
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:242--&gt;
The following message.&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:243--&gt;
Is expected. (It's normal that CD/DVD's are mounted read-only.)&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:244--&gt;
Help fixing this bug is welcome!&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;=== VLC / Video Player Crash === &lt;!--T:245--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:246--&gt;
You can use this workaround.&lt;/translate&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
VLC -&gt; Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Video -&gt; Output -&gt; X11 -&gt; Save
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;== Minor == &lt;!--T:247--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;=== &quot;apt-get source package&quot; will show &quot;dpkg-source: warning: failed to verify signature&quot; === &lt;!--T:248--&gt;
&lt;/translate&gt;
&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:249--&gt;
More info [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2013/08/msg00000.html here] (and in the following mails).&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:109--&gt;
It is only a warning. If you want, you can get rid of it with the following workaround.
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:110--&gt;
1. Modify &lt;code&gt;/etc/dpkg/origins/default&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/debian /etc/dpkg/origins/default
&lt;/pre&gt;

2. {{Code|apt-get source package}}

&lt;translate&gt;
&lt;!--T:250--&gt;
3. Undo afterwards to prevent unexpected issues.
&lt;/translate&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/whonix /etc/dpkg/origins/default
&lt;/pre&gt;

Even though we're doing our best to offer you good tools to protect your privacy while using a computer, '''there is no magic or perfect solution to such a complex problem'''. Understanding well the limits of such tools is a crucial step in, first, deciding whether Whonix is the right tool for you, and second, helping you making a good use of it.

= Tor exit relays can eavesdrop on communications =

'''Tor is about hiding your location, not about encrypting your communication.'''

Instead of taking a direct route from source to destination, communications using the Tor network take a random pathway through several Tor relays that cover your tracks. So no observer at any single point can tell where the data came from or where it's going.

[[Image:htw2-tails.png|frame|none|alt=| A Tor connection usually goes through 3 relays with the last one establishing the actual connection to the final destination]]

The last relay on this circuit, called the exit relay, is the one that establishes the actual connection to the destination server. As Tor does not, and by design cannot, encrypt the traffic between an exit relay and the destination server, '''any exit relay is in a position to capture any traffic passing through it'''.

For example, in 2007, a security researcher intercepted thousands of private e-mail messages sent by foreign embassies and human rights groups around the world by spying on the connections coming out of an exit relay he was running. See [http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/09/embassy_hacks Wired: Rogue Nodes Turn Tor Anonymizer Into Eavesdropper's Paradise.] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyHbBEU w]).

'''To protect yourself from such attacks you should use end-to-end encryption.'''

'''Whonix includes many tools to help you using strong encryption''' while browsing, sending email or chatting in [[Documentation]].

&lt;ref&gt;Source: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#CanexitnodeseavesdroponcommunicationsIsntthatbad Tor FAQ: Can exit relays eavesdrop on communications?] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyAPZe4 w])&lt;/ref&gt;

= Whonix makes it clear that you are using Tor =

Tor tries to prevent attackers from learning what destination websites you connect to.

'''Unless''' you are using the Optional Configuration [[Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP | Hide the fact, that you are using Tor/Whonix from your ISP]], '''your ISP or your local network administrator''' can easily check that you're connecting to a Tor relay, and not a normal web server for example.

'''Unless''' you are using the Optional Configuration [[Tunnel Proxy or SSH or VPN through Tor | Tunnel Proxy/SSH/VPN through Tor]], '''the destination server you are contacting through Tor''' can know whether your communication comes out from a Tor exit relay by consulting the publicly available list of exit relays that might contact it. For example using the [https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py Tor Bulk Exit List tool] of the Tor Project.

'''So unless you are using Optional Configurations to prevent this, using Whonix doesn't make you look like any random Internet user.''' The anonymity provided by Tor and Whonix works by trying to make all of their users look the same so it's not possible to identify who is who amongst them.

Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more [https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en diverse] their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of them. Convince other people to use Tor, too!

&lt;ref&gt; Attribution: Two sentences in the &quot;Whonix makes it clear that you are using Tor&quot; chapter, have been forked from the [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Tor] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyWNl4n w])website, which was licensed under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/ Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyX0A2y w]) at this point. &lt;/ref&gt;

= Whonix might make it clear you are using Whonix =

Even though Whonix developers designed Whonix not to reveal the fact that you are a Whonix user to your ISP, there might still be unknown methods to find out you are.

In case you care about that, see also the Optional Configuration [[Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP | Hide the fact, that you are using Tor/Whonix from your ISP]].

= Man-in-the-middle attacks =
A man-in-the-middle attack (MitM) is a form of active eavesdropping in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them, making them believe that they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker.

[[Image:man_in_the_middle.jpg|frame|none|alt=|Illustration of a man-in-the-middle attack]]

While using Tor, man-in-the-middle attacks can still happen between the exit relay and the destination server. The exit relay itself can also act as a man-in-the-middle. For an example of such an attack see [http://www.teamfurry.com/wordpress/2007/11/20/tor-exit-node-doing-mitm-attacks MW-Blog: TOR exit-node doing MITM attacks] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUybaLf8 w]).

'''Again, to protect yourself from such attacks you should use end-to-end encryption''' and while doing so taking extra care at verifying the server authenticity.

Usually, this is automatically done through [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security SSL] certificates checked by your browser against a given set of recognized [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority certificate authorities]. If you get a security exception message such as this one you might be victim of a man-in-the-middle attack and should not bypass it unless you have another trusted way of checking the certificate's fingerprint with the people running the service.

[[Image:ssl_warning.png|frame|none|alt=|This Connection is Untrusted]]

[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-tell-if-my-connection-is-secure How do I tell if my connection to a website is secure?] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUzXi9P5 w])

The eff has a fantastic [https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https interactive illustration] who can see what when (not) using Tor and when (not) using SSL.

But on top of that, the certificate authorities model of trust on the Internet is susceptible to various methods of compromise.

For example, on March 15, 2011, Comodo, one of the major SSL certificates company, reported that a user account with an affiliate registration authority had been compromised. It was then used to create a new user account that issued nine certificate signing requests for seven domains: mail.google.com, login.live.com, www.google.com, login.yahoo.com (three certificates), login.skype.com, addons.mozilla.org, and global trustee. &lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://blogs.comodo.com/it-security/data-security/the-recent-ra-compromise/ Comodo: The Recent RA Compromise] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyeEwBE w])&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2011, DigiNotar, a Dutch SSL certificate company, incorrectly issued certificates to a malicious party or parties. Later on, it came to light that they were apparently compromised months before or perhaps even in May of 2009 if not earlier. Rogues certificates were issued for domains such as google.com, mozilla.org, torproject.org, login.yahoo.com and many more. &lt;ref&gt;Source: [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it The Tor Project: The DigiNotar Debacle, and what you should do about it] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyf0rpk w])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''This still leaves open the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack even when your browser is trusting an HTTPS connection.'''

There are alternatives to SSL, worth checking out if they may be useful for you. Unfortunately, they cannot be used as a drop-in replacement. Tools providing connection security include [http://web.monkeysphere.info/ Monkeysphere], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_%28SSL%29 Convergence], [http://perspectives-project.org/ Perspectives Project] and Tor hidden services&lt;ref&gt;[[Hidden Services]] are [[Hidden_Services#Notes_about_End-to-end_security_of_Hidden_Services|automatically encrypted end-to-end]]. (More specific: Tor to Tor)&lt;/ref&gt;.

On the one hand, by providing anonymity, Tor makes it more difficult to perform a man-in-the-middle attack targeted at '''one specific person''' with the blessing of a rogue SSL certificate. But on the other hand, Tor makes it easier for people or organizations running exit relays to perform large scale MitM attempts, or attacks targeted at '''a specific server''', and especially those among its users who happen to use Tor.

In all cases, you are advised to use additional message encryption for encrypting your mails, chats and so on. Tools such as encrypted messengers (Covered on the [[Chat]] page.), GPG [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard (wikipedia)], [[Software#Encrypt.2C_decrypt.2C_sign.2C_and_verify_text_using_OpenPGP.3B_GnuPG_frontend | KGpg]] and [[E-Mail | Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy]] and enigmail (gpg add-on) may be useful.

&lt;ref&gt; Quoted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack wikipedia Man-in-the-middle_attack] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyk0IKX w]) and [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/detecting-certificate-authority-compromises-and-web-browser-collusion Tor Project: Detecting Certificate Authority compromises and web browser collusion] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUykcmES w]). &lt;/ref&gt;

= Confirmation attacks =
Quoted from Tor Project: &quot;One cell is enough to break Tor's anonymity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyo9u9N&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Tor design doesn't try to protect against an attacker who can see or measure both traffic going into the Tor network and also traffic coming out of the Tor network. That's because if you can see both flows, some simple statistics let you decide whether they match up.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
That could also be the case if your ISP (or your local network administrator) and the ISP of the destination server (or the destination server itself) cooperate to attack you.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tor tries to protect against traffic analysis, where an attacker tries to learn whom to investigate, but Tor can't protect against traffic confirmation (also known as end-to-end correlation), where an attacker tries to confirm an hypothesis by monitoring the right locations in the network and then doing the math.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

= Whonix doesn't encrypt your documents by default =

The documents that you might save inside Whonix will not be encrypted by default. The [[Advanced Security Guide]] recommends [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Full_Disk_Encryption | to fully encrypt the host]].

It is likely that the files you may create will keep tracks that they were created using Whonix. (Under research.)

= Whonix is not amnesic =
Other than Tails, Whonix is not an Amnesic Live CD. If you install Whonix on your computer this will leave local traces on the harddrive, that you installed Whonix on that device. Any files you create will still exist after powering off or rebooting unless you securely wiped all signs of their previous existence.

There are no special measures to limit what is written to disk. This includes (non exclusive list) user created files, backup files, temporary files, swap, chat history, browser history and so on. Whonix acts like an ordinary installed operating system. It can also not be prevented, that the host memory [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap swaps] to the host disk. There is a [[SecurityGuide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots | Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots]] and it is [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Full_Disk_Encryption | recommended to apply Full Disk Encryption on the host]].

For more information on this topic, see also: [[FAQ#Is_there_a_substitute_for_Whonix.27s_lack_of_an_Amnesic_feature_.2F_Live_CD.2FDVD.3F_Forensics.3F|Is there a substitute for Whonix's lack of an Amnesic feature / Live CD/DVD? Forensics?]]&quot;

= Whonix doesn't clear the metadata of your documents =

Numerous files format store hidden data or metadata inside of the files. Text processors or PDF files could store the name of the author, the date and time of creation of the file, and sometimes even parts of the editing history of the fileâ€¦ those hidden data depend on the file format and the software used.

Images file formats, like TIFF of JPEG, probably take the prize in this field. Those files, created by digital cameras or mobile phones, contain a metadata format called EXIF which can include the date, time and sometimes the GPS coordinates of the picture, the brand and serial number of the device which took it as well as a thumbnail of the original image. Image processing software tend to keep those data intact. The internet is full of cropped or blurred images for which the EXIF thumbnail still contains the full original picture.

'''Whonix doesn't clear the metadata of your files for you'''. Yet, it's still within the Whonix' design goal to help you do that. For example, Whonix already comes with [[Metadata |  MAT]], which is a Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit.

= Whonix doesn't encrypt the Subject: and other headers of your encrypted e-mail messages =

Please note that the Subject: as well as the rest of the header lines of your OpenPGP encrypted e-mail messages are not encrypted. This is not a bug of Whonix or the [http://www.mozilla-enigmail.org/forum%20viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=328 OpenPGP] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyt6L0f w]) protocol; it's for backwards compatibility with the original SMTP protocol. Unfortunately no RFC standard exists yet for Subject encryption.

If you are looking for an e-mail client supporting OpenPGP encryption (enigmail), [[E-Mail | Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy]] is recommended.

= Tor doesn't protect you from a global adversary =

A global passive adversary would be a person or an entity able to monitor at the same time the traffic between all the computers in a network. By studying, for example, the timing and volume patterns of the different communications across the network, it would be statistically possible to identify Tor circuits and thus matching Tor users and destination servers.

It is part of Tor's initial trade-off not to address such a threat in order to create a low-latency communication service usable for web browsing, Internet chat or SSH connections.

For more expert information see [https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf Tor Project: The Second-Generation Onion Router], ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyv297d w]) part 3. Design goals and assumptions.

= Whonix doesn't magically separate your different contextual identities =

It is usually not advisable to use the same Whonix-Workstation to perform two tasks or endorse two contextual identities that you really want to keep separate from another. For example hiding your location to check your email and publishing anonymously a document.

First, because Tor tends to reuse the same circuits, for example amongst a same browsing session. Since the exit relay of a circuit knows both the destination server (and possibly the content of the communication if not encrypted) and the address of the previous relay it received the communication from, it makes it easier to correlate the several browsing requests as part of a same circuit and possibly made by a same user. If you are facing a global adversary as described above, it might then also be in position to do this correlation.

Second, in case of a security hole or a misuse in using Whonix or one of its application, information about that Whonix-Workstation could be leaked. That could reveal that the same person was behind the various actions made inside that Whonix-Workstation.

'''The solution to both threats is either following the [[SecurityGuide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots | Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots]] and/or to [[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations | use multiple Whonix-Workstations]]''' every time you're using a new identity, if you really want to isolate them better.

[[TorController | arm's]] &quot;New Identity&quot; button forces Tor to use new circuits but only for new connections: existing connections might stay open. Plus, apart from the Tor circuits, other kind of information can reveal your past activities, for example the cookies stored by your browser. So this feature of arm is not a solution to really separate contextual identities.

= Whonix doesn't make your crappy passwords stronger =

Tor allows you to be anonymous online; Whonix ensures that the whole operating system is forced through Tor (and many other extra Security features, see [Design]). But again, '''neither of both are magic spells for computer security'''.

If you use weak passwords, they can be guessed by brute-force attacks with or without Whonix in the same way. To know if your passwords are weak and learn good practices to create better password, you can read [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Examples_of_weak_passwords Wikipedia: Weak Passwords] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUz4uxz8 w]).

= Whonix doesn't secure your host =

Whonix can only be as secure as the host is. Of course you can simply use Whonix on top of your every day operating system as probably many people do. You will be much safer if you follow the [[Pre_Install_Advice#Recommendation_to_use_a_dedicated_host_operating_system | Recommendation to use a dedicated host operating system]].

= Only Whonix-Workstation is designed for anonymous activity =

Easy: All anonymous activity should only happen inside Whonix-Workstation. Nowhere else.

Explanation: The host operating system (the operating system running VirtualBox, the system you used before ever downloading Whonix) will NOT be torified. Never do any anonymous tasks on your host.

The Whonix-Gateway's only purpose is running Tor and the firewall. In most cases there is no need to modify things on the Gateway. Minor modifications such as setting up bridges are documented.

= Whonix doesn't improve security/anonymity outside of Whonix =

Obviously, Whonix can't stop people from looking over your shoulder or stop (mobile) providers from pinpointing your location if you gave it to a website for (mobile) phone verification.

= Whonix doesn't prevent you from shooting your own feet =

If you login to your personal Facebook account, which is bound to your real name, you are obviously not anonymous!

This will be substantiated on the later page [[DoNot | Non technical steps staying anonymous]].

= Whonix doesn't defeat Stylometry =

Whonix does not obfuscate your writing style.

This will be substantiated on the later page [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging | Anonymous Surfing, Posting and Blogging]].

= Whonix does not protect against social engineering. =
Whonix does not protect against social engineering&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29&lt;/ref&gt; hacks. One example of such a hack would be convincing you to send a copy of your logs from the Whonix-Gateway. Another example would be convincing you to give away logs/information about your host machine. The best tool in maintaining anonymity is knowledge that comes from research and experience.

= Whonix does not (yet)... =

Whonix is currently alpha quality software and missing features, some of them security related. Some of the following will probably never get &quot;fixed&quot; or implemented because they are impossible to do in a software only project.

Whonix in its current form does not:

* Encrypt your stuff.
* Wipe RAM on shut down. See [http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/30076/ Idea #30076: Enhancy Privacy/Security, Wipe RAM on shut down, reboot and trigger].
* Wipe video RAM on shut down. See [https://tails.boum.org/todo/erase_video_memory_on_shutdown/ Tails -erase video memory on shutdown].
* Make weak passwords stronger.
* Protect against local adversaries, who for example can mount cold boot and evil maid attacks.
* Protect you if you don't read our [[Documentation]] or do stupid things or change default settings without knowing what you are doing.
* Automatically apply security updates. This was a conscious decision because automated updates also come with their own set of security problems. However, you will be notified about updates on Whonix-Workstation by whonixcheck.
* Protect against global network adversaries.
* Protect against hardware or software backdoors.
* Automatically protect against MAC address fingerprinting on public networks.
* Protect against the more skilled software attacks, unless you use [PhysicalIsolation].
* By default, protect you if Tor is somehow broken. You can improve that to some extent (with caveats) by chaining Tor with SSH, proxies or VPNs.
* By default, hide the fact that you are using Tor, though there is an optional feature, [[Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP | Hide the fact you are using Tor/Whonix]].
* Use all the possible hardening options like full PIE and grsecurity. It doesn't use AppArmor profiles for everything.
* Obfuscate your writing style, defeat Stylometry.
* Have deterministic builds, see [[Dev/Archived Discussions]]. Also Tor itself does not have deterministic builds yet, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3688 Bug 3688].
* This list might be incomplete. Please read the rest of the [[Documentation]] (and perhaps [[Design]] as well) to if you want an overview about security, what's in and what not.

If you want to help us improve the security of Whonix, please join the discussions on [[Dev/Archived Discussions]] or on the developer mailing list.

= Whonix is a work in progress =

Whonix, as well as all the software it includes, are under continuous development and might contain programming errors or security holes. [[Download#Stay_tuned | Stay tuned]] to Whonix development. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.

The basic functionality is ready. You can use Whonix to browse the web and [[Hidden Services | host hidden services]], use email, IRC, ssh, etc. Development is still ongoing and more features are being added to Whonix. If you want join the development process or want to see what issues are still open, see our [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues Whonix github issues tracker].

From [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-October/025921.html Whonix 0.4.5 release announcement] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUzBC5nH w]):

&lt;pre&gt;
 Whonix uses the best of both worlds, the Isolating Proxy concept [2]
and the Transparent Proxy concept. At the moment there are no known
anonymity leaks or proxy bypass problems. The principal design is less
vulnerable for any kind of leaks. At time of writing (October 2012) I
have been working on the theoretical concept and practical
implementation for 9 months, the basics have been developed by (at
least) three people, adrelanos, smarm and anonymous. [1] [2]

  Although Whonix has been developed with greatest care, a negative,
being leak free or being free from mistakes in the extended project
description [1], can not be proven. This is Whonix's first release
announcement. I hope skilled people look into the concept and
implementation and fail to find anonymity related bugs.&lt;/pre&gt;

|description=Whonix Documentation. Crash Course in Anonymity and Security on the Internet.
}}

This documentation is a crash course in anonymity and security on the Internet. Whonix is a technological means to anonymity, but staying anonymous is not just a technological problem: No tool is enough to keep you safe.  

Anonymity is a complex problem without an easy solution, and security is only as strong as its weakest link—often the user. The more you know, the safer you can be. Fortunately, basic knowledge and caution will go far.

= Why are the Whonix images so big? =

Compared to other &quot;Tor-VM&quot; or &quot;Tor-LiveCD/DVD&quot; projects which sometimes use special minimal or stripped down Linux distributions (e.g. TinyCore, DSL, Puppy) Whonix is larger, both VMs together are currently almost 2 GB.

One reason for that is, that small distributions do not meet our requirements, namely: upstream needs to have a proactive security policy.

* Most &quot;minimal&quot; distributions are small projects that do not have a dedicated security team that audits packages and releases security patches quickly.
* We need a distribution that fully signs updates (this is always desirable but especially so when updating over untrusted exit relays).
* For such distributions security consist in a small attack surface &lt;ref&gt;Our attack surface is still very small, no network listening services, just a few selected applications.&lt;/ref&gt;, but that's about it. A full distribution supports MAC, kernel patches, IDS...
* &quot;Big&quot; projects with many users and developers (many eyeballs) are inherently more trustworthy.
* Debian has loads of Security Features, see (Ubuntu article, but mostly true for Debian) [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features/ Ubuntu Security Features]. Small distributions don't have it.

There are maintenance and usability reasons:

* We want to support a wide range of user cases such as hosting hidden services, small distributions usually have limited repositories.
* Whonix, since based on Debian, is a complete operating system. An anonymous general purpose operating system, not a stripped down minimal system. [[Features]], [[Design]]
* Debian has much more documentation than small distributions, also about topics such as Security and Hardening.
* Creating a slim system is difficult and requires a lot of of development time. This should not be Whonix's core competence. There are projects which do not focus on anonymity/privacy/security, but which are dedicated to a slim system.
* To my knowledge, slim systems could never really attract big market shares. I don't know, why they are less favored, if they have worse marketing or for other reasons. It's the fact that they don't have a huge user base, that matters.
* Slimming down the system will result in many &quot;strange bugs&quot;. People who are used to Debian or Ubuntu will wonder why some things do not work or why Whonix is broken.

Another reason is that Whonix does not play in the anonymity oriented Live CD/DVD market:

Whonix is a new category of anonymity tools. Whonix does not have the requirement to fit on a DVD. (Although in future we may develop a Whonix Live DVD.) While anonymity oriented Live CD/DVD's have to balance between functionality they want to provide available space and security; Whonix, as an anonymous general purpose operating system can by default or optionally provide any functionality and doesn't has to care so much about space. For example, integrating BitCoin into Whonix would be, except for documentation, quite simple.

Last but not least reason, not putting security over usability:

* Short: I don't put security over more users.
* Long: For example, this interesting statement from Tor developer Roger Dingledine: [http://www.mail-archive.com/liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu/msg00022.html Mixminion vs Tor]. Similar applies here. Mixminion is a high latency remailer, with cover traffic, protection against traffic confirmation (end-to-end correlation), theoretically more secure than Tor. The problem is &quot;theoretically&quot;. They couldn't attract enough users and without enough users it's equally (in)secure as Tor. That's why they decided, to no longer work on Mixminion. Whonix also needs lots of users, to 1) get press/publicity 2) more developers 3) more research and audits. 2 and 3 will result in more security. Creating the most secure and most slim system, would only attract a few geeks. The geeks get hopefully satisfied, because Whonix is highly customizable. Nothing prevents from optionally slimming, hardening and customizing.

= Why is KDE (big) the default desktop environment? Why not use a minimal DE? =

This was a difficult development path decision. Many people, including adrelanos, didn't like the old Openbox interface in TorBOX (deprecated project name) 0.1.3 because it was too inconvenient, non-intuitive, uncommon, difficult, etc. There is no rational unarguable choice for the best desktop.

MATE has not been choosen, because there are no packages in Debian repositories. It is my understanding, that GNOME2 is deprecated and only a fraction of GNOME2 users likes GNOME3. Other desktops (LXDE, XFCE, Openbox) are less widespread, not so pretty, in adrelanos opinion harder to use (even difficult to create a desktop shortcut), thus not attracting many users.

Choosing KDE is a personal preference by Whonix developer adrelanos. KDE has one advantage, the only developer likes it and remains interested to maintain and develop Whonix further.

You are free to uninstall KDE and install any other desktop environment of your own choice.

I recognize, that this is a non-ideal situation. Inspired by [http://www.browserchoice.eu/ select your webbrowser], it would be ideal if Whonix would offer to choose which desktop to install but unfortunately, such a wizard [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2012/09/msg00003.html does not exist yet]. There are no development resources to implement such a solution. Help is welcome.

If there were contributors, we could maybe also include other desktop environments by default or offer alternative Whonix builds with different default desktop environments or ideally implement a &quot;choose your desktop&quot; option after first boot of Whonix.

Please also read [[#Why are the Whonix images so big?]] above, the same applies here.

See also [[Other Desktop Environments]] for workarounds/alternatives.

= Why not use a Live CD/DVD as Whonix-Workstation operating system? =

We discussed this and came to the decision, that Live CD/DVDs are not suited for Whonix.

Positive:

* often actively maintained
* stabilized
* hardened GNU/Linux distribution
* with advanced features.

Negative:

* no timely security updates
* &lt;s&gt;not persistent&lt;/s&gt; limited persistence
* not flexible enough
* anonymity orientated Live CD/DVD's often have their own Tor enforcement included, which would lead into a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#ToroverTor Tor over Tor] scenario

= Why should I (not) trust Whonix? =

See [[Trust]] for a long answer.

= Whonix crashes because of PAE? =

See [[Starting Whonix#PAE Crash|PAE crash]].

= You should not waste the Tor network's bandwith by downloading operating system updates over Tor! =

Short answer: We discussed this with torproject.org and were allowed to do so.

Long answer: We had a thread about this issue, [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/Dev/ArchivedDiscussion/DOCUMENTATION#updatesoverTorshouldnotwasteTorbandwidthDOCUMENTATIONSOLVED updates over Tor, should not waste Tor bandwidth]. Discussed thoroughly. We speculated a lot and thought about solutions until we finally did what we should have done in the first place. We asked torproject.org, see [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023486.html tor-talk Operating system updates / software installation behind Tor Transparent Proxy]. Click [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/subject.html#23507 here] for an overview of all answers. Andrew Lewman ([https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en Executive Director, Director, press contact]), too, downloads a lot of updates over Tor and [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023493.html did not complain].

= Alpha? Beta? Stable? Development? Whonix version scheme =

'''TODO: Needs revision.'''
'''DRAFT!'''

Is Alpha, Beta or Stable related to security? No, our design makes security issues inherently less likely to occur.

We are still working heavily on usability, working on some user facing stuff (like zenity). Until those are all integrated and tested we wouldn't be doing our users a favor by calling it not an alpha. They get turned away if things don't work right.

Alpha: Features are constantly being added.

Beta: Only fix important stuff, test it.

Stable: Build and release the current beta with all fixes when we feel it's ready. We expect beta testing to last a month or so, shorter if we can get feedback from more users.

Development version: Only goes for the source. Things can be added in order to get feedback from others. The longer things are inside, the longer they are accepted. Doesn't mean they are better tested. Sometimes the source can even break.

= Why do you use the 32 bit operating system, not 64 bit? =

Update: A critical VirtualBox bug: [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10853 VirtualBox ticket #10853: Mouse position repeatedly reset to top and/or left of screen].

Since Whonix 0.4.0 the build environment uses grml-debootstrap (perhaps kameleon in future) and chroot. Image creation goes much faster and changing the architecture requires only a very few changes. If Whonix revives contributions or due to user feedback it might be possible in future to have 32 and 64 bit downloads.

Old statement: 32bit software runs without problems on 32bit and 64bit hosts. 64bit software not so much. Because we generally don't control what host OS people use, I chose to base Whonix on 32bit. Secondly, 64bit software needs more RAM, we already run 3 operating systems on a system which, eats RAM. Let's better minimize that. KVM and other solutions improve RAM usage through page sharing or what it's called, VirtualBox doesn't. Thirdly, according to Brad Spengler and/or PAX team, amd64 is a brain dead instruction set and actually worse than x86, despite the large address space making ASLR more effective. They recommended to use grsec on x86 and I hope we can switch to a grsec kernel (wheezy has one, let's see if they maintain it).

= Why aren't you using OpenBSD, it's the most secure OS ever!!!1! =

OpenBSD fails completely for the Tor threat model which downloading and updating software over untrusted exit relays. OpenBSD does not offer any signed files, they do not even offer hash sums for all required files (at least the ports tar ball doesn't have one). When asking about that the answer is &quot;buy the CDs&quot; (=something like $80 per year if you want to stay current). As if CDs via post through a 3rd party reseller offer a better trust chain than mirrors with hash sums, let alone proper WOT signatures. There are alternatives to GnuPG if it's just about the license... Further, tracking stable - which is recommended for production systems - is needlessly complex: it requires the user to recompile everything even though there are usually only a few packages that require an update. The most fitting approach would be to just apply the patches from the errata but apparently not all security related fixes in -stable are listed there and OpenBSD admits as much that patch branch is really not user-friendly. Further problems: OpenBSD seems to default to using very &quot;conservative&quot; hash algorithms, md5 or sha1 which are both broken. This clashes with their claimed crypto focus. FDE support is lacking/limited. There doesn't seem to be a modern mandatory access control (MAC&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control&lt;/ref&gt;), instead there's systrace which has been criticized for having fundamental security problems (this may or may not have changed since then). &lt;s&gt;OpenBSD doesn't seem to be using PIE executables by default, meaning, it doesn't really have ASLR.&lt;/s&gt; Documentation about such issues is completely lacking. &lt;s&gt;There's also the strange policy of sticking with bind and sendmail when there were secure-by-design alternatives (see [http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf PDF!]) with much better track record&lt;/s&gt;, BIND-9, despite the rewrite, continues to be a security hazard just judging by the OpenBSD errata entries. OpenBSD would otherwise be a great choice for Whonix-Gateway. It has a very capable firewall, the track record is probably better than of any other OS though they (just like their competition for fairness sakes) prefer to label &quot;potential&quot; code execution vulnerabilities as a DoS. OpenBSD is also a very small OS (small TCB), its kernel may be the most secure UNIX-like kernel, but it's still a monolithic kernel. Their claim of being THE most secure operating system has become more and more dubious since the introduction of actually usable microkernels. In summary: I don't like their attitude and several essential (for Whonix) security properties are missing.

Also see [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.os.openbsd.bugs/18754 security vulnerability - NTP not authenticated] and it doesn't look like they step forward to fix it. The suggestion was to authenticate the connection to the NTP server, which is not possible for Whonix for many reasons. &lt;ref&gt;We need to distribute the trust, not using only one NTP server and we must use free services which are available for anyone and not something requiring an own server.&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenBSD's target audience aren't end users, that's why they don't care to provide signed updates for the masses, see [http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/38041/how-to-check-downloaded-package-on-openbsd-5-1 How to check downloaded package on OpenBSD 5.1?].

OpenBSD's website isn't reachable over SSL or as a Tor hidden service. How are users supposed to securely view the OpenBSD site and not learn things set up by a man-in-the-middle?

If they don't attract the masses, ordinary crackers, hackers and the security research community doesn't get attracted as they do with more popular operating systems. At the same time a targeted attack gets easier, because people who get paid to find exploits can find them more easily.

If this sounds a bit harsh on OpenBSD it's because it could be such a great OS but it isn't (mostly more for political and social/&quot;ego&quot; than technical reasons) which is frustrating.

Update 1: There is now Qubes OS and I am missing such innovative security improvements from OpenBSD, which claims to be the most secure operating system.

Update 2: OpenBSD according to [http://www.bsdstats.org/ bststats.org] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6F4tFWwNy w]) has very few users. 56 at time of writing. I know, that people must undergo a rather complicated manual process to get counted, however compared to 24,168 FreeBSD users, that's not very much.

= Why don't you use FreeBSD, which is more secure?!? =
It is difficult (very time consuming in this case) proofing a negative. Such as proofing non-existent security features. Either a search results in &quot;security feature implemented&quot; or nothing.

To avoid getting out of date and hurting other people's feelings, it's better not to make any statements about non-existent security features, but just asking the appropriate questions.

Does FreeBSD have a secure package manager? Can every user download from an already existing '''signed''' repository or is it required to run an own repository? Does it defend against outdated metadata, can a man-in-the-middle use a roll back or freeze attack against the repository? Does it defend [https://www.cs.arizona.edu/stork/packagemanagersecurity/ this] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Ev4smCoD w])? Does it cover the [https://www.updateframework.com/projects/project/wiki/Docs/Security TUF threat model] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Ev4owhEP w])?

Not finding anything doesn't mean there isn't something. The best way to get confirmation about the absence of security features or in other words, the best way to get a confirmation about possible attacks due to missing security features is asking the developers of that project. (An honest reply from Open Source projects is assumed.) There are simply too many distributions to ask these things.

So, if you believe that FreeBSD is a secure distribution, if you are even advocating that standpoint, then the burden of proof is on the person making the claim (you). It's up to you to come up with references that these security features are implemented. It is not up to the Whonix developers to spend a lot time, proving that these security features are non-existent. Or it's up to you to create such references by asking the distribution's developers. Another way would be coming up with arguments why these security features are unnecessary (this is unlikely in the specific case of package manager security). Until the claim of being a more secure distribution gets substantiated, please do not take offense by not considering that distribution. 

= Why don't you use OpenWRT, which is more secure?!? =
Same reasons as above for FreeBSD.

OpenWRT do not have signed packages.

= How is Whonix different from Tails? =

See [[Comparison with Others]].

= Why don't you merge with Tails and join efforts? =

'''UPDATE 7:''' Rewrite.

'''This is a subjective statement of opinion by Whonix developer adrelanos.''' (Still open for feedback, corrections, improvements!)

[https://tails.boum.org/ Tails] is a respected project with similar goals (anonymity, privacy and security), which exists for many years and which has multiple developers, experience and a working infrastructure. The Whonix and the Tails developers cooperate to some degree and are discussing things, which are related to the projects on the Tails developers mailing list. Parts of Whonix are based on Tails. For example tails_htp was invented by Tails. Whonix also profits from their previous (Debian) upstream efforts (packaging and so on), their old and current discussions, their research, design documents, experience, feedback and so on.

Even though adrelanos highly values Tails, why is Whonix a separate project and not a contribution to Tails?

Whonix can not be merged into Tails by adrelanos. There are technical, skill and political reasons.

Adrelanos doesn't/didn't know how to implement various things into Tails, and don't/didn't know when the Tails developers will add them, which are adrelanos's priorities, but knew how to solve them in a separate project (Whonix), at least as in a way, that users are provided with instructions how to do it. Some examples.

'''Some of these items may already be either partially or fully solved in Tails by now.'''

'''TODO''' Broken since migration to whonix.org. Ignore for now.

Also political and design decisions differ too much.

* As a code contributor to Tails, adrelanos would have to accept decisions made by the Tails decision making process and couldn't simply modify anything as personally desired, preferred or believed to be the best solution. That's the great thing about Free Software. You are free to disagree and to create a fork. Since adrelanos motivation was not about a Live DVD and personally found improving Tails much more difficult than starting fresh, a new project, Whonix, was created.
* Source Code Merge Policy:
** Whonix: does not yet have a comprehensive merge policy. It's welcome, but not compulsory to write a design or documentation.
** Tails: In adrelanos opinion, [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/merge_policy/ Tails merge policy] is too strict. This is not a complaint or critique. They will have their reasons for that and it has to be noted, that Tails is still doing well and useful for many people. Anyone who does not agree has the freedom to contribute to another project or to start a new project. Adrelanos just made use of that freedom.
* One big difference is, that Tails is a Live DVD and therefore inherits some restrictions and limitations. Tails must fit on a DVD, while Whonix does not have such a requirement. Whonix has higher hardware requirements, but therefore more space to implement features. That means that initially fewer people will be able to use Whonix, but over the years available hardware to people will (hopefully) improve. Whonix is discovering both, theoretically and practically, new designs. Over time, depending on user feedback and general interest, a Live DVD or Live Blu-ray might be created.

= How is Whonix different from the Tor Browser Bundle? =

See [[Comparison with Others]].

= Does this mean that, for example, my IP and location is safe when using Skype? =

This answer has been moved to the [[Voip#Skype|Voip]] page.

= Isn't VirtualBox an insecure choice? =

VirtualBox is not an ideal choice, I acknowledge it, see: [[Dev/Virtualization Platform]], but there are no better alternatives, which are usable by a big amount of people.

It's about different goals. Whonix's main goal is to protect the user's IP/location.

At the moment Whonix is practically more secure in many cases, see [[Security in Real World|Whonix Security in Real World]].

Saying VirtualBox is too weak, is theoretical and does not have any practical implications at the moment. What are the alternatives? Continue running Tor and torified applications on the host? Running TBB and running into another [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/firefox-security-bug-proxy-bypass-current-tbbs proxy bypass bug]? People failing to correctly torify software? Software [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea not honoring proxy settings]?

On the other hand, how many known exploits exist for VirtualBox? What's the track record of exploits?

I acknowledge, that virtual machine exploits may become a problem in future. Right now, Whonix provides more security out of the box. Whonix right now, advertises and educates the security by isolation principle.

Anyone seriously looking into Whonix for security will read the [[Documentation]], the [[Security Guide]] and the [[Advanced Security Guide]] and find out about [[Physical Isolation]]. Whonix is an appetizer for the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy Isolating Proxy Concept] and [http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2008/09/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html Security by Isolation].

A secure replacement for VirtualBox is already in development. [http://qubes-os.org/ Qubes OS] is already in a productive state, it only lacks hardware support and it's being worked on. [http://qubes-os.org/trac/wiki/UserDoc/TorVM TorVM for Qubes (qubes-tor)] was [https://github.com/abeluck/qubes-tor#acknowledgements inspired] by Whonix. (See [[Comparison with Others]].)

The responsible thing to do from security perspective would have been in past, to switch from Windows to GNU/Linux and nowadays it would be to switch to Qubes OS. If you are most serious about Tor security, using Whonix with Qubes OS + physical isolation would be the most secure way.

Many users are still on Windows or Linux. Whonix can right now fill the void and improve real world security. They are better using Whonix, which is up to date, actively maintained and developed than any seriously outdated projects like JanusVM.

Whonix can not serve all target audiences. The more security educated/interested people will use things like [[Physical Isolation]] or qubes-tor. Hardcore security educated/interested people will probably build their own custom hardened solutions, but can still profit from Whonix's research and source code. Those more hardened solutions, such as the [[Hardened Gentoo TG|Hardened Gentoo Whonix-Gateway]] are more difficult to use and can therefore not be the default for Whonix.

'''UPDATE 1''': Using Whonix on top of Qubes OS looks much easier now. See the [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/featureblog/2013/02/running-whonix-on-top-of-qubes-os-anyone-interested-unpacking-ova-images/ blog post].

= Will there be a Whonix Live CD or DVD? =

Unless someone joins the project and contributes, this won't happen in near future.

Whonix developer adrelanos has limited knowledge about Live CD/DVD creation. At the moment Whonix is a rather simple project. Many things, get delegated to upstream. VirtualBox features to run on various platforms, Debian provides a fine operating system, hardware support is delegated to the host operating system and VirtualBox, Tor is providing a fine anonymizer. Creating a Live CD /DVD would be difficult, especially the hardware support. Whonix is also too big and that would be very difficult to fix, see [[#Why are the Whonix images so big?]] above. Adrelanos lacks experience about Live CD/DVD deployment.

A clean way to do it would be to contribute to Tails instead, see [https://tails.boum.org/todo/Two-layered_virtualized_system/ Tails wishlist: Two-layered virtualized system]. A similar feature was already implemented in Liberte Linux, but ultimately rejected ([http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2012/msg00248.html reference]).

For an alternative also see the next question below.

= Is there something like Whonix Live? =

Whonix runs fine when the host operating system is installed on external media.

There is a [[Pre_Install_Advice#Recommendation_to_use_a_dedicated_host_operating_system|Recommendation to use a dedicated host operating system]] and a [[Pre_Install_Advice#Recommendation_to_use_Whonix_on_External_Media|Recommendation to use Whonix on External Media]].

It's the user's responsibility to honor that advice.

= Why can't I ping the Whonix-Gateway? =
Whonix-Gateway is firewalled (see ''{{WhonixFirewall}}'' or in Whonix source code) and does not answer to ping (-like) commands for security reasons. In most cases, you don't need to ping the Gateway.

If you really want to ping the Gateway or really want some uber special setup you can test wise clear all firewall rules with the [https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/dangerous_scripts/dev_clearnet dev_clearnet] script (or hack Whonix's firewall to not load at all). It's only for experts and you need to comment out the ''exit 0'' at the beginning.

= You should add full disk encryption to Whonix! =

'''Short''': No, you should add full disk encryption to your host!

'''Long''': It is technically impossible to ship Whonix with an encrypted disk for several reasons.

While you can change the password for a luks/TrueCrypt/whatever volume, only the password for the masterkey gets replaced. The masterkey itself remains unchanged. (The masterkey is NOT some kind of backdoor, it's just how things work. Otherwise you would have to re-encrypt each time you want to change the password.)

In Whonix the masterkey would be known to everyone who downloads and changing the password wouldn't change the masterkey.

So all that could be added would be an option to encrypt it with a freshly and locally created masterkey (and user chosen password) after user downloads Whonix.

But there are two problems. There is no &quot;encrypt after installing&quot; software for Linux, like there is TrueCrypt for Windows.

The other one is that the host can swap to the disk and therefore leak stuff to the perhaps unencrypted host disk.

Therefore the only secure solution is applying full disk encryption on the host. as recommended in the [[Advanced Security Guide#Full Disk Encryption]]: 

= Speed up the Whonix-Gateway? Speed up Tor? =

''Is there a way to configure the number of nodes in a circuit and to allow selection according to their speeds?''

Remember, [[About#Based on Debian|Whonix is based on Debian, KDE, VirtualBox and Tor.]] It is nothing very special. Therefore Whonix does not limit Tor and your options in any way.

If you learn how to configure Tor in such a way in Debian command line, you also learned how to do it in Whonix-Gateway. While it's possible to learn it yourself and do manually, this is not recommended in Whonix-Gateway since also the Tor developers don't recommend it.

For these reasons there are no instructions in Whonix documentation how to do it. If you find general instructions the only thing changing would be that you do it in Whonix-Gateway instead on the host.

Please also see the next question below.

= Does Whonix modify Tor? =

'''NO!'''

Tor's configuration file has been adapted for Whonix, you can check it on Whonix-Gateway in &lt;code&gt;/etc/tor/torrc&lt;/code&gt;. There are no patches to Tor. The normal Debian Tor package is being used in Whonix.

Whonix tries to be as less special as possible to ease security auditing of Whonix.

Any changes to the Tor routing algorithm should be proposed, discussed and eventually implemented upstream in Tor on torproject.org. And if discussion fails, a Tor fork&lt;ref name=fork&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)&lt;/ref&gt; could be created. Tor has already been forked at least once.

Doing such changes directly in Whonix would limit discussions about Whonix to the security of the modified routing algorithm. To allow further exploration of Whonix's security, Whonix developer adrelanos believes, it is required to be as agnostic as possible about all parts of Whonix.

= Why doesn't Whonix improve Tor? =

Please see the question above.

Creating Whonix is difficult and time consuming enough. Improving Tor is left to the people who are better at this job. Any bugs/suggestions related to torproject.org will of course be reported. [[Dev/Threat Model#Design Document, innovations and research|Happens.]]

= Can you improve Tor? =

No.

Any improvements to Tor should be proposed upstream. If adrelanos finds a bug or has a suggestion it will be proposed upstream on torproject.org. [[Dev/Threat Model#Design Document, innovations and research|Happens.]]

For reasons why there isn't an improved version of Tor in Whonix see the question [[#Does Whonix modify Tor?]] above.

Anyone unhappy with Tor should provide patches upstream and as last resort fork&lt;ref name=fork /&gt; it. Hypothetically, if the fork&lt;ref name=fork /&gt; gets better respected than the original project, then Whonix will of course seriously consider switching.

= You should disable JavaScript by default! =
No, this isn't a good idea for many reasons.

Whonix is an anonymity distribution gluing together concepts, which are generally respected by educated people and known to work reliably. It's not a browser project trying to create a secure browser such as &quot;Privacy Browser - solves all browser fingerprinting problems&quot;. Whonix does not have the manpower to create such a browser. In theory, and even if it had, it would make more sense to create a new project &quot;Privacy Browser&quot; and when it gets better than Tor Browser to use, re-configure Whonix to use &quot;Privacy Browser&quot; instead of Tor Browser.

Whonix also doesn't modify Tor Browser for the same reasons also listed in the already answered questions [[#Does Whonix modify Tor?]], [[#Why doesn't Whonix improve Tor?]] and [[#Can you improve Tor?]] above.

Whonix includes Tor Browser and with only [[Tor Browser#Tor Browser in Whonix differences|minor]] differences, such as proxy settings for [[Stream Isolation]].

Mike Perry, developer of Tor Browser has also made a good posting why it's better to have JavaScript enabled in Tor Browser by default, see [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024227.html tor-talk Tor Browser disabling Javascript anonymity set reduction]. In summary to his post, Tor Button and the Tor Browser patches to handle the most serious issues related to JavaScript. There are no IP/location bypass problems. Although there are outstanding issues &lt;ref&gt;[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-fingerprinting tbb-fingerprinting]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-linkability tbb-linkability]&lt;/ref&gt;, deactivating JavaScript by default couldn't attract enough users, without enough users the anonymity set will also reduce. When someone deactivates JavaScript it may be even more fingerpintable, depending on how many people disable JavaScript, which no one really knows. The Tor Project also plans to create a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9387 security slider] and has recently updated its [https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#TBBJavaScriptEnabled JavaScript FAQ] stating {{Code|Until we get there, feel free to leave JavaScript on or off depending on your security, anonymity, and usability priorities.}}

Last, but definitively not least, Whonix shares the same [[Fingerprint]] as other Tor Browser Bundle users, which is good for anonymity.

= How difficult is it to develop Whonix? =

This is just adrelanos's opinion and feeling.

Whonix source code isn't rocket science. In comparison to other things it's very simple.

I think it's best to make a comparison table.

Legend: 10 * equals very difficult.

&lt;pre&gt;**********&lt;/pre&gt;
1 * equals very easy.

&lt;pre&gt;*&lt;/pre&gt;
Table:

&lt;pre&gt;********** Hand written binary code.
********* Cryptographic algorithms development
********* Rocket science
********* Compiler development
******** Assembly language
******** Kernel development
******** Reverse engineering
******* Tor core development
****** Programming languages such as C/C++.
***** Using Hardened Gentoo
**** Scripting language
*** Whonix related anonymity/privacy research
** Writing Whonix documentation
** Writing Whonix bash scripts
* Using a computer&lt;/pre&gt;
= What is clearnet? =

This term has two meanings.

&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting to the regular internet not using Tor (or other anonymity networks), and/or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting to regular servers (which are not Tor hidden services) (using Tor or not)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

= Can I use DNSCrypt in Whonix? =

Yes, see [[Secondary DNS Resolver]].

= Why not use DNSCrypt as default for Whonix? =

[http://dnscrypt.org/ DNSCrypt] may have good use cases for clearnet. In context of Whonix it's not useful and should not be installed and activated by default for everyone. It does not do what you may think, does not magically solve all DNS related security issues, does not implement end-to-end DNS encryption to the destination server. (That conceptually can not work. If you knew the IP of the destination server in advance, you wouldn't require DNS in the first place.) The server will still see all DNS requests in cleartext. This is only a short version for the many reasons, why it should not be activated by default for everyone

More reasons: Tor is about distributing trust. Tor's DNS server change as circuits change, thus trust is distributed. Circuits are stream isolated (for pre-installed applications) and change every ten minutes. As far as I know, there are only two public open resolvers supporting the protocol: [https://cloudns.com.au/ CloudNS] and [http://www.opendns.com OpenDNS]. (There is a free server-side proxy that anybody can use.)

I have no reason to distrust public resolvers supporting DNSCrypt and/or OpenDNS. Even if I trusted the people running DNSCrypt servers, their servers would have to be trusted as well and that's not wise to let DNS security for all Whonix users depend on few servers. It's also about load balancing. If Whonix was to use a DNSCrypt supporting server by default and that server decides to forbid connections from the Tor network (due to the Tor network used to abuse their servers with DDOS or for whatever reasons) or if the servers go down for maintenance, DNS would break for all Whonix users.

For even more explanations on DNSCrypt, see forum post [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/3c99944b/#3ea4 one] and [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/e659f3ad/#bff5 two] related to this topic.

= Can I use DNSCrypt on the host, in my router, for clearnet? =

Yes, if you want. Also read the entry below.

= Does DNSCrypt on the host or in my router, harm anonymity when using Tor/Whonix? =
Short answer: No.

Long answer: No, DNSCrypt on the host or in your router only affects your clearnet activities. Tor assumes your local network and ISP to be totally unsafe and untrustworthy. Neither Tor nor Whonix are affected by DNS settings on your host or in your router.

Whether DNSCrypt is useful for your clearnet activities or not - that isn't clear. There are pro and contra arguments. If you ask me, it's useful when using foreign or untrusted Wifi networks (shared with others), since they could modify and/or read your DNS requests. Other than that, I think you will just shift the trust from one party (ISP) to another (DNSCrypt supporting DNS server, ex: OpenDNS). If the DNSCrypt supporting DNS server (ex: OpenDNS) is more trustworthy, then it's good. Which one should be trusted more, your ISP or OpenDNS - I don't know.

= What's the difference of installing a VPN on the host versus installing on Whonix-Gateway? =

This entry assumes, you already decided to use a VPN.

If you did that after reading the [[Features#VPN / Tunnel support|VPN / Tunnel Support]] documentation, and decided you want to use a VPN, continue reading, otherwise you can skip this FAQ entry.

If the VPN is installed on the host:

* all Whonix traffic goes: user -&gt; VPN -&gt; Tor -&gt; destination
* all host traffic goes through the VPN: user -&gt; VPN -&gt; destination
* When Whonix-Gateway ever gets compromised, this is a tiny bit more secure compared to having the VPN installed on Whonix-Gateway.

If the VPN is installed on Whonix-Gateway:

* all Whonix traffic goes: user -&gt; VPN -&gt; Tor -&gt; destination
* all host traffic goes in the clear: user -&gt; destination

When making the decision, you must ask yourself...

What do you want to hide from your ISP? All traffic? Then install the VPN on the host.

What should your VPN provider be able to see? All traffic? Then install the VPN on the host.

Should your VPN provider only be able to see Tor traffic but not your clearnet traffic? Then install the VPN on Whonix-Gateway.

= Does Whonix/Tor protect you from the NSA or other three letter agencies? =
If you are under active surveillance:&lt;br /&gt;
Whonix can do nothing against miniature cameras or microphones in your room etc.

If you are under passive surveillance just like anyone ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program) PRISM]):&lt;br /&gt;
That depends if Tor protects from such threats. The answer to that is not clear:
https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/029014.html

And even if Tor was a whole lot better, you can never prove a negative. So it's better to hesitate to any broad claims as it would be skeptical if any other project claimed that.

Also Whonix does not make such broad claims. For a related statement about three letter agencies, also see:
[[Technical Introduction#With more technical terms]]

= check.torproject.org says &quot;Sorry. You are not using Tor.&quot; =
When you see this when using Whonix, probably everything is okay. You can make sure everything is okay if you want.

https://check.torproject.org (&lt;code&gt;check.tpo&lt;/code&gt;) fails in some cases to detect Tor exit relays. It's a bug in &lt;code&gt;check.tpo&lt;/code&gt;, which The Tor Project should fix. Whonix can do nothing about it.

You could use (using the Tor Browser Bundle on the host) [https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html ExoneraTor: a website that tells you whether a given IP address was a Tor relay] or a search engine to find out if the given IP address is or was a Tor exit relay.

If the IP you are seeing is different from your own real external IP address, it's another strong sign that everything is fine.

= If I do X - can this leak DNS and/or my real external IP/location? =
Nothing you do inside Whonix-Workstation can cause IP/DNS leaks as long you leave Whonix-Gateway unchanged (besides documented stuff, which goes ok, such as bridges, hidden services, updates).

However, there are still ways you could shoot your own foot. It might be [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous rather than anonymous]], you may de-anonymize yourself by doing [[DoNot|things you should not do]], things like [[Secondary_DNS_Resolver]]s may lead to DNS related identity correlation or the application you are using may be hostile to you, such as in the example of [[Voip#Skype|Skype]].

= Graphical Whonix-Gateway? =
If you think, it uses too much RAM or generally prefer a terminal version of Whonix-Gateway, you can use reduce Whonix-Gateway's RAM to 128 MB and [[Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]] will automagically boot into a terminal version of Whonix-Gateway.

Whonix aims to become as accessible in usability as possible. Sorry, if you're a Linux geek and were happy with Whonix-Gateway 0.5.6, but you're not the ''only'' target audience. Whonix is also an attempt to get more {{Code2|casual users}}&lt;ref&gt;https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=57532&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPWIA6D5Odg&amp;lc=i9pytdxZ1Z9C1she5VfyQBYWIBXCvH8A80AFs309Cfg linked comment].&lt;/ref&gt; using Tor, because {{Code2|the more people use Tor, the better the anonymity Tor can provide becomes}}&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Quote]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[...] Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of them. Convince other people to use Tor, too!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;.

As in Whonix 0.5.6 it was difficult for users who never used Linux before to do tasks such as upgrading or configure obfuscated bridges etc. Many things are simpler and more encouraging in a graphical desktop environment. Such as:

* setting up bridges / flashproxies
* auditing logs
* auditing iptables
* auditing the system architecture in general
* running [[Test]]s
* running [[Dev/Leak_Tests|Leak Tests]]
* editing Tor configuration file {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}
* editing firewall settings folder {{Code2|/etc/whonxi_firewall.d}}
* reading status messages (whonixcheck and timesync)
* changing Tor circuit.
* copying and pasting (configuration) commands, (error) messages and logs
* running tshark / wireshark
* [[FAQ#What.27s_the_difference_of_installing_a_VPN_on_the_host_versus_installing_on_Whonix-Gateway.3F|tunneling only Whonix-Gateway's traffic through a VPN]]

And big black text-only window (terminal) looks scary. A graphical desktop environment is also a prerequisite for further planed improvements, such as a Whonix Controller, which will be a graphical Whonix Controller, where you have buttons such as

* &quot;create hidden blog&quot;, and then you end up with a preconfigured blog
* &quot;enable TorChat&quot;
* &quot;backup hidden service keys&quot;
* and so forth).

Also terminal-only environments are often unusable by users with disabilities. That's why Whonix {{Whonix6}} and above will feature an optional graphical desktop environment.

If you think, the graphical Whonix-Gateway uses too much disk size and/or you want to do non-originally intended things, such as running Whonix completely in RAM, sorry to say. Whonix has never been developed with low size, low RAM or low system requirements in mind. See also [[#Why are the Whonix images so big?]] and [[#Will there be a Whonix Live CD or DVD?]].

Advanced users can build Whonix from source code and use a build configuration to create a terminal-only version of Whonix-Gateway. (Refer to [[Dev/Build Documentation|Build Documentation]] in case that is of interest to you.)

Last but not least, if there was a [[Contribute#Release_Manager|Release Manager]] contributing to The Whonix Project or at least someone willing to build terminal-only versions of Whonix-Gateway (which is not about developing, only about running the build script and uploading), we could easily provide a terminal-only version of Whonix-Gateway. As long very few people are contributing to The Whonix Project, this won't be possible.

See also [[Other Desktop Environments]] for workarounds/alternatives.

= Is there a substitute for Whonix's lack of an Amnesic feature / Live CD/DVD? Forensics? =
'''Short answer''': &lt;br /&gt;
No.

'''Long answer''': &lt;br /&gt;
[[Warning#Whonix_is_not_amnesic]] and there is no [[#Will there be a Whonix Live CD or DVD?|Live CD/DVD of Whonix.]]

Many people suggested workarounds such shredding Whonix's hard disk images, having a zip archive of Whonix's hard disk images and restoring them every time they are using Whonix, restoring a fresh [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots|snapshot]] every time they use Whonix, using [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Full_Disk_Encryption|Full Disk Encryption]] and so forth.

These aren't substitutes for having an amnesic system. Not storing sensitive data on hard disks in the first place is much safer than dealing with it after the fact. In that regard, amnesic live systems are superior, because they do exactly this by design.

Never storing data unencrypted in the first place is much safer than trying to wipe it later. Using Full Disk Encryption is very useful. Still, this isn't an applicable stopgap as long as Whonix doesn't offer an amnesic version for every person in all cases. In some areas in the world, having encrypted disks isn't wise.

You should be very cautious about disk forensics claims. We don't know about swap or other strange things operating systems and harddrives are doing nowadays. We are not experts in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_forensics forensics]. Just have a basic understanding of it and know to be cautious. Check out [http://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/12153-Data-Remains-on-USB-and-SSDs-After-Secure-Erase.html Data Remains on USB and SSDs After Secure Erase] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_leveling wear levelling]. Ordinary hard disks also sometimes mark sectors as bad an never release their data. (?) See also [http://www.forensicswiki.org forensics wiki] to learn some more about the possibilities of forensics.

No matter how clever the setup sounds, nothing can beat an amnesic system. At bare minimum, before making any claims:

# Make an image of the hard drive.
# Run Whonix, do some stuff.
# Make again an image of the hard drive.
# Compare the images.

Without performing these basics steps, the setup may sound clever, but may not work out so well against actual forensics. So if you are concerned about local forensics, at bare minimum, use full disk encryption. When established Open Source encryption solutions such as Linux dmcrypt are rightly used, they usually hold their promises. Again, it's not as good as an amnesic system. If being forced to surrender the password is of concern to you, Whonix may not be the right tool for you. Again, without anyone doing actual forensics, be careful with any claims or assumptions how well data may be gone.

|description=Censorship Circumvention. Get around network bans. Using Whonix with (private) (obfuscated) bridges.
}}
= What bridges are and when to use them =
When using Tor with Whonix in its default configuration, anyone who can observe the traffic of your Internet connection (for example your Internet Service Provider and perhaps your government and law enforcement agencies) can know that you are using Tor.

This may be an issue if you are in a country where the following applies:

# '''Using Tor is blocked by censorship:''' since all connections to the Internet are forced to go through Tor, this would render Whonix useless for everything except for working offline on documents, etc.
# '''Using Tor is dangerous or considered suspicious:''' in this case starting Whonix in its default configuration might get you into serious trouble.

Tor bridges, also called Tor bridge relays, are alternative entry points to the Tor network that are not all listed publicly. Using a bridge makes it harder, but not impossible, for your Internet Service Provider to know that you are using Tor.

If you are in one of the situations described above you might want to use Tor bridges in Whonix. Please also read The Tor Project's [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges dedicated page about bridges] to get a general idea about what bridges are.

In order to use bridges, you must know in advance the address of at least one bridge. The Tor Project distributes bridge addresses in several ways, for example from their [https://bridges.torproject.org/ website] and via email.

''Bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than other entry points. If you life in a uncensored are, they are not necessarily more secure than entry guards.'' ''Source: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorFAQ#bridgevsnon-bridgeusersanonymity bridge vs non-bridge users anonymity].''

= If using Tor is dangerous in your country =
The Tor Project's [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges documentation on bridges] mainly focuses on censorship circumvention, this means when the usage of Tor is blocked by censorship. If using Tor is dangerous or considered suspicious in your country, then there are some extra rules that you should follow in order to prevent you from being identified as a Tor user.

''Bridges are important tools that work in many cases but'' '''they are not an absolute protection''' ''against the technical progress that an adversary could do to identify Tor users.''

1. When starting Whonix for the first time, start it while the host internet connection is deactivated, which is most secure. Otherwise the Whonix-Gateway would automatically connect to the public Tor network. Alternatively, Start VirtualBox -&gt; Right Click in Whonix-Gateway -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network -&gt; Adapter 1 -&gt; Deactivate the box ''&quot;Enable Network Adapter&quot;''. (less secure)

2. Only use [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#PluggableTransports {{Code|obfuscated bridges}}] since they are harder to identify than other bridges.

3. The less publicly known the bridges are, the better. Unfortunately, since some bridge addresses can be obtained by anyone from the Tor website or by email, it is also possible for an adversary to get the same bridge information by the same means. The Tor Project has some protection against that, but they are far from being perfect.

So the best is if you can find a trusted friend or an organization in a different country who runs a {{Code|private obfuscated bridge}} for you. In this case &quot;private&quot; means that the bridge is configured with the option {{Code|PublishServerDescriptor 0}}. Without this option The Tor Project can learn about the bridge and may distribute its address to others and so it could end up in the hands of your adversary.

See also [[Hide Tor and Whonix from your ISP]]!

= How to use bridges in Whonix =
== Using obfuscated obfs2, (private) and/or ordinary bridges ==
Whonix does not yet include a {{Code|bridge mode}} that guides you through the process of setting up bridges before connecting to Tor. You must add bridges manually to {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

({{Code|Private}}) {{Code|obfs2}} bridges can currently be configured on Whonix-Gateway the same way, they would be configured when not using Whonix, i.e. just like on a server without graphical user interface. Have a look at {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} &lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/stable/whonix_gateway/etc/tor/torrc /etc/tor/torrc on github].&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc&lt;/pre&gt;
== Using (private) obfuscated obfs3 bridges ==
{{Code|obfs3}} bridges should work in Whonix-Gateway. {{Code|obfs3}} is already preinstalled from torproject's apt repository.

= Flash Proxy Bridges =
'''Untested!'''

'''Unfinished!'''

This has NOTHING to do with Adobe Flash.

Should work in Whonix-Gateway as well, but require some fiddling. See also [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/729ba238/ Forum topic].

1. Enable port forwarding from your host operating system to Whonix-Gateway. Enter this command in a terminal on the host.

&lt;pre&gt;VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; --natpf1 &quot;9000&quot;,tcp,127.0.0.1,9000,,9000&lt;/pre&gt;

2. Create a file /etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user (Or if you using a graphical Whonix-Gateway, you can use the desktop shortcut.)

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user&lt;/pre&gt;

3. Add the following content.

&lt;pre&gt;
GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_FLASHPROXY=1
FLASHPROXY_PORT=9000
&lt;/pre&gt;

4. Reload Whonix Firewall. (Or if you using a graphical Whonix-Gateway, you can use the desktop shortcut.)

&lt;pre&gt;sudo /usr/bin/whonix_firewall&lt;/pre&gt;

5. Install flashproxy.

Ok, this is a bit tricky, since there is no Debian package with the flashproxy-client.

Either get it from here:
https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/#how-to

Or...

Go to the [https://blog.torproject.org/ Tor Blog] and look for the latest pluggable transports bundle. This has not been documented yet:
https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/53

6. Set up a Port Forwarding from your Router to your Computer

== Introduction ==

If you are only interested in Tor hidden services, move on to [[Hidden Services]]. This page discusses and compares different kinds of Location/IP Hidden Servers.

There are three different ways to run location hidden servers. Tor Hidden Services, pagekite. .onion webspace and Anonymous Third Party Hosts. Below is an overview.

If you don't know which one to use, probably Tor Hidden Services are most easy and most anonymous. Below is also a conclusion and a comparison table.

== Tor Hidden Services ==

* censor resistant, no one can take the .onion domain offline &lt;ref&gt;Besides compromising of the host and / or flood attack.&lt;/ref&gt;
* additionally accessible over tor2web over http &lt;ref&gt;Which doesn't offer as much censor resistance as the .onion domain does&lt;/ref&gt;
* they are completely free
* no sign up required
* and don't require any additional software besides of course the server software you want to anonymize.
* Can be run at home; on any server you physically own; or on (anonymous) third party hosts.
* Has its own wiki page, see [[Hidden Services]].

== VPN with Remote Port Forwarding ==

* censor resistance depends on the VPN provider
* reachable by clients, which do not have to use Tor
* there are probably no free VPN services providing [http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/16627/does-portforwarding-present-a-risk-to-anonymity Remote Port Forwarding]
* probably sign up required
* Can be run at home; on any server you physically own; or on (anonymous) third party hosts.

== pagekite ==

* alternative service called [https://pagekite.net/ pagekite]
* must comply with [https://pagekite.net/humans.txt pagekite terms of service]
* requires registration and an (anonymous) [[E-Mail]] address
* free for Free Software authors; can apply for a free account; or subscription based service
* known to work inside Whonix-Workstation out of the box
* less tested by Whonix developers
* there is no documentation besides this chapter, however, usage is simple and their service is well documented. See [https://pagekite.net/wiki/Howto/PageKiteOverTor/ Running PageKite over Tor].
** Instead of localhost you could use the Whonix-Gateway IP 192.168.0.10 and a custom port such as 9159, i.e. replace &quot;''--torify=localhost:9050''&quot; with &quot;''--torify=192.168.0.10:9159''&quot;.
** Or you could drop the &quot;''--torify''&quot; switch at all and even follow the default pagekite GNU/Linux tutorial, because ''misc traffic'' in Whonix-Workstation gets automatically routed through Tor's TransPort.
** See [[Stream Isolation]] for an explanation of ''misc traffic'', custom Socks Ports and Tor's TransPort in Whonix.

== Anonymous Third Party Hosts ==

* Has its own wiki page, see [[Hosting]].
* There are some free .onion web hosting services. Also paid ones.
* There are also anonymous VPS servers, although no free ones, which would require [[Money|anonymous money]].

== Conclusion ==

Each way to run location hidden servers has its own advantages and disadvantages.

With Tor Hidden Services, you don't have to learn and obtain anonymous money, which is difficult on its own. You have to trust no one, but your own skills setting up a server. No one can censor the server, there is no signup, no terms of service. Disadvantage is, if someone compromises your hidden service either by an successful attack against Tor hidden services are by an successful attack against your server software and breaking out of Whonix, it's game over. It's only accessible over .onion (visitors need Tor) and tor2web does not get indexed by search engines. Tor Hidden Services are only online as long as your server is online.

A free (or paid) .onion web space host can steal your domain any time and take it over. You don't have to worry about server security and successful attacks against the Tor hidden services won't lead to your location or IP address.

Anonymous Third Party Hosts for VPS hosting involve anonymous money, which is difficult on its own. They can provide clearnet domains and/or you can use them to host Tor hidden services. You don't have to worry about server security and successful attacks against Tor hidden services won't lead to your location or IP address.

|description=Using OnionCat with Whonix
}}

= OnionCat =

== Introduction ==

'''Untested. Please leave feedback if it worked for you.'''

Introduction into OnionCat:

* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/OnionCat torproject wiki about OnionCat] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EQUoe9Cs w])
* [http://www.cypherpunk.at/onioncat cypherpunk.at/onioncat] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EQUqZawz w])
* [https://cryptoanarchy.org/wiki/OnionCat cryptoanarchy.org about OnionCat] ([http://web.archive.org/web/20120810015004/https://cryptoanarchy.org/wiki/OnionCat webarchive]; [http://www.webcitation.org/6EQUZky7n webcitation])

OnionCat (Tor) might work with Whonix. GarliCat (i2p) might partially work with Whonix.

General debugging hints:

* There at multiple sources for issues, you might stumble upon.
* Therefore it's recommended, before you try using OnionCat with Whonix, if that doesn't endanger you, try first to successfully test OnionCat without Whonix.
* As soon as you learnt that, it eliminated one source for possible issues (OnionCat) and can start learning how to use it with Whonix (which might introduce new issues, but enhanced security will be your reward).
* You also have to learn first, how to use hidden services with Whonix, see [[Hidden Services|hosting hidden services]] for reference.

== Over Tor ==

As long you want to use OnionCat over Tor, it may work.

IPv6 is currently disabled on Whonix-Gateway, because Tor doesn't support IPv6 yet, and we didn't see need for it. We also have no IPv6 firewall for Whonix-Gateway yet, because it's disabled. Anyway, that will probably not be an issue. IPv6 on Whonix-Workstation, where OnionCat will be running, is enabled. Since only OnionCat's underlying operating system requires IPv6, but not the Tor process there will probably be no problem. OnionCat on Whonix-Workstation will probably translate the IPv6 requests to IPv4 to the Tor process which is running on Whonix-Gateway. Therefore probably no IPv6 on Whonix-Gateway is required.

There instructions on cryptoanarchy.org look very promising. To use them with Whonix, minor modifications are required. Follow the instructions on [https://cryptoanarchy.org/wiki/OnionCat cryptoanarchy.org] ([http://web.archive.org/web/20120810015004/https://cryptoanarchy.org/wiki/OnionCat webarchive]; [http://www.webcitation.org/6EQUZky7n webcitation]) but execute the steps on the correct machine, either on Whonix-Gateway or on Whonix-Workstation.

(0). Install ocat &lt;-- on Whonix-Workstation

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install onioncat
&lt;/pre&gt;

(1). Create a hidden service &lt;-- on Whonix-Gateway

(2). Create the directory /etc/tor/ocat &lt;-- on Whonix-Gateway

(3). Find the hostname of your hidden service &lt;-- on Whonix-Gateway Also possibly see [[Hidden Services|hosting hidden services]] for reference. Debugging: It's recommended to test if your hidden service is reachable first (for example, use test wise a hidden webserver), before you proceed with OnionCat.

(4). Start ocat &lt;-- on Whonix-Workstation

(5). Final nodes. &lt;-- on Whonix-Workstation

== Over i2p ==

GarliCat over i2p might only work, if you use [[i2p|ip2 over Tor]].

There was the idea to create an [[Dev/Inspiration#i2pBOX|i2pBOX]], but it never came to live due to lack of community interest, which means GarliCat directly over i2p will not be supported by Whonix.

As soon as i2p over Tor is working in Whonix-Workstation, you can probably follow the instructions on [https://cryptoanarchy.org/wiki/OnionCat cryptoanarchy.org] ([http://web.archive.org/web/20120810015004/https://cryptoanarchy.org/wiki/OnionCat webarchive]; [http://www.webcitation.org/6EQUZky7n webcitation]) without modifications.

}}
{{Header}}
= Tor Hidden Services - EASY =

== Introduction ==

Be sure to read and understand [https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en Tor: Hidden Service Protocol] (general information) and [https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en Configuring Hidden Services for Tor] (standard setup, no isolated proxy) first. Note that hidden services are always only reachable using Tor or tunnel services, such as tor2web, ([https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/tor2web be careful]).

You do not need SSL &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer&lt;/ref&gt;, because connections to Tor hidden services are end-to-end encrypted by default &lt;ref&gt;http://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-SSL-equivalent-for-Tor-Hidden-Services&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;To be exact, only tor-to-tor, see [[Hidden_Services#Notes_about_End-to-end_security_of_Hidden_Services|Notes about End-to-end security of Hidden Services]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is handy, as you do not have to bother with self singed certificates or certificate authorities.

An adversary can see whether the service (and presumably Tor) is up and running or not.

== Hosting ANY Hidden Services ==
You can provide '''any''' server service, which relies on TCP, such a web servers, irc servers, chat servers and so forth. UDP and IPv6 are not supported by the Tor network, but if required you could use [[OnionCat]] as workaround.

Below on this page is an ''example'' for a Hidden Webserver. On the [[Voip]] page is an example for a Hidden Voip Mumble Server.

Even if someone hacks your hidden server software (lighttpd, thttpd, apache, etc.), the attacker can not steal your hidden service key or bypass Tor, see [[Comparison with Others#Attacks|Attack on Whonix]]. The key is stored on the Whonix-Gateway. Once you cleaned your Whonix-Workstation, no one can impersonate your hidden service anymore.

While using Whonix we're quite confident that there are no IP/DNS leaks, but hardening the server software is still left to the user. In the [[Security Guide]] and in the [[Advanced Security Guide]] you'll find pointers for hardening.

Beware of application level leaks. See [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]] for definition. For example,

* If you are using the Apache web server, it is advised to install [http://packages.debian.org/source/wheezy/libapache-mod-removeip libapache-mod-removeip]&lt;ref&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install libapache-mod-removeip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well. A combination of Apache and mediawiki without libapache-mod-removeip being installed, wouldn't be the optimal case, since mediawiki by default puts IPs of anonymous editors in the public accessible editor logs. The IP would be 192.168.0.10. That could not be used to identify you, because that is not your real external IP address, but it would identify the server as a hidden service behind a Whonix-Gateway.&lt;ref&gt;Since its easy to know that the internal LAN IP 192.168.0.10 is usually used by Whonix-Gateway.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore any instructions how to hide the IP address for your specific server software should be applied. Also other hardening instructions are recommended to apply. For example,

* If you are using the Apache web server, see the following footnotes. &lt;ref&gt;
(Source: [http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/407fce8f/?limit=25#478a old forum])

Stop Apache.

In {{Code|ports.conf}}:

&lt;pre&gt;
NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80
Listen 127.0.0.1:80
ServerName localhost
&lt;/pre&gt;

In {{Code|sites-available/default}}:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Start Apache.

Now Apache is not listening on {{Code|192.168.0.10}}, but only on {{Code|127.0.0.1}}. So now we somehow need to redirect {{Code|192.168.0.10:80}} to {{Code|127.0.0.1:80}}.

It can be done with a firewall rule or netcat:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ncat -l 192.168.0.10 80 -c 'ncat 127.0.0.1 80'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hidden Webserver ==

=== Setup ===
On your Whonix-Gateway:

Open {{Code2|''/etc/tor/torrc''}}.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc&lt;/pre&gt;

Read the comments. These explain where to find your .onion URL and to backup your hidden service keys. Comment in the following two lines.

&lt;pre&gt;
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 192.168.0.11:80
&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart Tor.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service tor reload&lt;/pre&gt;
Reminder: To get your hidden service url.

&lt;pre&gt;
## requires root: sudo su
nano /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname
&lt;/pre&gt;

Reminder: Backup your hidden service key, in case you want to be able to restore it, on another machine, on a newer Whonix-Gateway, after hdd failure, etc.

&lt;pre&gt;
## requires root: sudo su
nano /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/private_key
&lt;/pre&gt;

On your Whonix-Workstation:

Run the following commands to install lighttpd.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lighttpd
&lt;/pre&gt;

Done.

'''Note''', that it may take up to 30 minutes (or so?) until a fresh .onion domain gets reachable.

=== Debugging ===
Check permissions.

&lt;pre&gt;ls -la /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/&lt;/pre&gt;

In case you manually restored your hidden_service keys as root, Tor will fail to start. The folder must be owned by debian-tor. In that case, fix the permissions.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo chown debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/&lt;/pre&gt;
Note: Tor Browser will allow connections to ''127.0.0.1:80'' but not to ''192.168.0.11:80''.

In Whonix-Workstation, check if the service is available on 127.0.0.1:80.

&lt;pre&gt;## Circumventing Whonix uwt wget stream isolation wrapper.
/usr/bin/curl.real 127.0.0.1:80&lt;/pre&gt;

In Whonix-Workstation, check if the service is available on 192.168.0.11:80.

&lt;pre&gt;## Circumventing Whonix curl wget stream isolation wrapper.
/usr/bin/curl.real 192.168.0.11:80&lt;/pre&gt;

== Tips settings up any hidden service ==

Please test the example Hidden Webserver above first. It helps understanding this in general and will ease debugging.

Quoted from the Tor manual&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;HiddenServiceDir DIRECTORY

Store data files for a hidden service in DIRECTORY. Every hidden service must have a separate
directory. You may use this option multiple times to specify multiple services. DIRECTORY
must be an existing directory.&lt;/pre&gt;
Quoted from the Tor manual&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;HiddenServicePort VIRTPORT [TARGET]

Configure a virtual port VIRTPORT for a hidden service. You may use this option multiple
times; each time applies to the service using the most recent hiddenservicedir. By default,
this option maps the virtual port to the same port on 127.0.0.1 over TCP. You may override
the target port, address, or both by specifying a target of addr, port, or addr:port. You
may also have multiple lines with the same VIRTPORT: when a user connects to that VIRTPORT,
one of the TARGETs from those lines will be chosen at random.&lt;/pre&gt;
Read the [[Security Guide]].

Connectivity bugs:

* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3825 HS intro points overloaded with CREATE cells cause connectivity failures]

'''Not Whonix specific! Talking about Tor in general.'''

How safe are Tor Hidden Services?

This is a difficult question. Therefore state relevant facts, quotes and links here.

* At time of writing there are no known attacks used in the wild constantly deanonymizing Tor hidden services.
* 80 bit name hash and RSA-1024 sized keys
* Quote Mike Perry {{Code|Tor core people}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en&lt;/ref&gt;): http://www.mail-archive.com/liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu/msg05418.html
* Quote Mike Perry: http://www.mail-archive.com/liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu/msg05462.html
* Also see, [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love The Tor Project Blog: Hidden Services need some love].

== Hidden Service Authentication ==
Unpopular, interesting feature. [http://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/219/how-to-use-hidden-service-authentication How to use Hidden Service Authentication?]

== Notes about End-to-end security of Hidden Services ==

Hidden services are not really &quot;end-to-end&quot; encrypted, they encrypted only Tor to End. (or &quot;Tor to Tor&quot;) The communication between the browser or server and Tor is sent in clear text. This doesn't really constitute a security issue, as localhost (or Workstation to Gateway on an isolated network), is supposed to be secure. But it has some security implications:

With hidden services alone, without TLS enabled, the adversary only needs to compromise Whonix-Gateway to get knowledge of the content of the connection and the clients identity/location. To compromise the content of the connection, the adversary only needs to compromise either the gateway or the workstation.

With hidden services, and TLS enabled, an adversary needs to compromise Whonix-Workstation to gain knowledge of the content of the connection. The adversary would have to compromise Whonix-Gateway as well, to gain knowledge of the client's identity/location.

It is possible to use hidden services and TLS at the same time, i.e. https://****************.onion. There are only a very few hidden services reachable over TLS. For example https://pad.riseup.net/ can be reached over https://ttbmov2dezfs2fln.onion/. But since this only offers benefits to users of Whonix (and other Tor gateway implementations), there is no demand. It would provide some nice defense in depth as it eliminates a single point of failure.

It would open the question, how would the certificate be verified?

That's simple for private sites, where server and clients know each other. They simply verify it over preshared secure channel, for example, a meeting.

And public hidden services? It is unlikely, that certificate authorities will give out certificates for .onion sites. Startssl.com declined, because .onion is no .gTLD, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6116 Bug #6116: apply for .onion gTLD at IANA]. Although you could try asking other certificate authorities, if they offer SSL certificates for people who can prove that they own a .onion domain. You can prove, that you have control over the domain by editing its contents on their request.

But CAs should not be relied on anyway. See chapter [[SSL]].

Hidden Services with Whonix are still safer than running Tor and the server software on the same host, because even when misconfigured, there can be, by design, no IP or DNS leaks.

=== SECURITY Deterministic builds OPEN NEEDS_RESEARCH NEEDS_DISCUSSION ===

==== Ticket moved to github bugtracker ====

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/29

==== Old Notes ====

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) We should check if [https://gitian.org/ Gitian] can be used with Whonix. Deterministic builds (Gitian) should ensure, that the binaries are created from the source we claim. Others should be easily able to check that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) Since the scripts download and install the newest operating system security updates, this would cause different hashs. If we are going for this one, we'd need somehow to keep care of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(anonymous) building and diffing (before ever booting them up, or you'll see some more log and chache files) two T-G images on two different systems but on the same day (so we don't get different apt-get updates) yields following results:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/var/cache/ldconfig/aux-cache look harmless, cache files naturally differ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/etc/console-setup/cached.kmap.gz look harmless, cache files naturally differ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/boot/grub/locale/en_AU.mo en_CA.mo en_GB.mo sometimes there, sometimes not, looks harmless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/etc/apt/trustdb.gpg must be harmless (a single byte at the beginning differs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-25-generic needs to be unpacked and compared again:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mkdir /tmp/unpackinitrd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cd /tmp/unpackinitrd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cp /mntpoint/boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-25-generic .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gzip -dc &lt; initrd.img-3.2.0-25-generic | cpio -i&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;results: it's console-setup/cached.kmap.gz (again)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/var/lib/initramfs-tools/3.2.0-25-generic sha1 of the initrd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/lib/modules/3.2.0-25-generic/modules.dep because of vesafb.ko? seems related to building on virtualbox vs on bare metal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/etc/shadow different hash of the changeme password, random seed? Doesn't matter you should change it immediately anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(anonymous) I guess we '''could''' disable all update repositories in sources.list while building and get a more easily verifiable deterministic build system but because Tor is so slow binary builds should really come with all updates available preinstalled. Again, ubuntu archive contains all the files to check manually. It's more work but certainly possible. Contrast that with the real difficulty of verifying compiled code vs its source... I forgot: Imagine there's a vulnerability in wget or apt-get, we should better patch that really quickly before using the vulnerable code to build our &quot;secure&quot; Whonix. (In case of apt-get we are pretty SOL in any case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) Since Whonix is now based on Debian Wheezy and the images are build using grml-deboostrap... I still have no idea if I build Whonix on day A and someone else builds it on day B, to verify its build from the same source. grml-deboostrap with naturally download and install the most recent versions while the build from day A lags behind. Old Debian packages can be downloaded from http://snapshot.debian.org/.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) For example let say sha256sum /usr/bin/nano 20ad0bc144d5f1d1f93e2f0afbc4b43b2fce3a2acf9ade751d6cf5d9bba34b4f /usr/bin/nano&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(adrelanos) http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/n/nano/nano_2.2.6-1.dsc contains sha256 sums&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be68e133b5e81df41873d32c517b3e5950770c00fc5f4dd23810cd635abce67a 1572388 nano_2.2.6.orig.tar.gz 4b341f6747f81e07e256baf11d1127b15d51012164dd1b05f0cd5fee87d9e1f1 30095 nano_2.2.6-1.debian.tar.gz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) How can I verify http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/n/nano/nano_2.2.6-1.dsc against the Debian archive key?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/n/nano/nano_2.2.6-1.dsc itself is only gpg signed with weak SHA1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) Does Debian somewhere publish the sha256 of /usr/bin/nano?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(adrelanos) unrelated, may be useful: http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2013/02/msg00034.html and http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/34413/integrity-check-against-package-repository&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== SECURITY VirtualBox replacement: Xen, KVM, libvirt OPEN NEEDS_RESEARCH ===

* (anonymous) Ubuntu/Linux has been &quot;rock solid&quot; for me, except for the occasional kernel panic caused by VirtualBox. And where there are bugs, there are security bugs. Xen is definitely capable: http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Host_Configuration/Networking and we could borrow from Qubes-OS (which probably is the most similar project to Whonix in terms of threat model and design). I'd put KVM as the second choice, we are already far too reliant on the Linux kernel (i.e. single points of failure) and it doesn't help with reducing the TCB. But both are stop gap till something like Genode.org becomes usable.
* (adrelanos) I agree, in long term we have to move away from VirtualBox. [http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=OTk5Mw The VirtualBox Kernel Driver Is Tainted Crap] says everything about their skills. After all the years they still require re-compilation of modules if the kernel has been updated. Imagine there was a kernel update and VirtualBox can no longer be started, iirc that happened in past. Although they have a good feature set and user interface.
* (anonymous) Actually recompiling is necessary because it's out of tree. It's out of tree because the kernel driver is crap.
* (adrelanos) If we switch to Xen or KVM we loose support for hosting Whonix on top of Windows. That would cost a lot users.
** (anonymous) users who don't really need Whonix, or they wouldn't even think about hosting on a proprietary system that phones home with hardware and serial numbers. The &quot;switch&quot; can be optional or additional too.
** (adrelanos) Every Windows user is at least a user compared to no user. As I often said, last time under &quot;better Marketing&quot;, more users leads to more reviews, more press, more developers, more progress etc. We easily disposed Windows as build platform, let's not easily dispose it as host platform. People start mostly with Windows and somtimes switch to Linux when they get to know it over time. Most Tor users are probably Windows users but everyone is required for a good anonymity set.
* (adrelanos) The [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/2500_create-vbox-vm 2500_create-vbox-vm] script contains within the functions general_setup, gateway_specific and workstation_specific the commands, which Whonix depends on. Some are unusual and might be unique to VirtualBox, such as synthcpu and GetHostTimeDisabled (no ultimately complete list).
* (adrelanos) Not really what this ticket stands for, but... Rudimentary [[VMware|Support for Whonix in VMware]] has been documented.

==== Xen ====

* (adrelanos) We have to research, if Xen is really suited for Whonix. How long will Ubuntu/Debian support Xen? In past I read that it is &quot;somewhat difficult to integrate Xen into a distro&quot;. It were stupid if we move to xen and then everyone dropping xen.
* (anonymous) Xen is &quot;industry standard&quot; see xen.org for who is using it... It won't get dropped, there's room for more than one. http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Category:Ubuntu
* (adrelanos) virt-manager is the only graphical user interface I've found for Xen. A desktop operating system over VNC is a real blocker. It works but is tiresome and any kind of multimedia does not work well either. Do we agree, that we need a replacement for VNC? We can try out SDL and see how 2D and 3D performance is. There is also [http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_VGA_Passthrough Xen VGA Passthrough] for full 3D, but I am not sure if it were secure.
* (adrelanos) See Qubes OS.

==== Qubes OS OPEN ====

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(anonymous) Give Qubes-OS a try, it's probably the nicest adaption of Xen for Desktop usage. They also get pretty good graphics (and overall) performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) [http://qubes-os.org/ Qubes OS] looks good indeed: http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/09/playing-with-qubes-networking-for-fun.html Hardware support is not so good that the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) Another project, TorVM for Qubes (qubes-tor): https://github.com/abeluck/qubes-addons/blob/master/qubes-tor/README.md https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-October/025960.html https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/qubes-devel/C1D5_tbl4jM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) Now that Qubes OS supports [http://wiki.qubes-os.org/trac/wiki/HvmCreate HVM] (although no Qubes Tools), it could become easier to use Whonix images inside Qubes OS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(adrelanos) To unpack the Whonix .ova images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tar -xvf Whonix-Gateway.ova Whonix-Gateway.ovf Whonix-Gateway-disk1.vmdk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) Open questions... How to convert the .vmdk to Qubes OS (Xen) compatible images?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(adrelanos) Converts, but not tested if they work in Qubes OS. ([http://unixfoo.blogspot.com/2008/12/vmware-to-xen-conversion.html source of information])&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

. # qemu-img info Whonix-Gateway-disk1.vmdk qemu-img convert Whonix-Gateway-disk1.vmdk -O raw Whonix-Gateway.img # qemu-img info Whonix-Gateway.img

* (adrelanos) Can .img images be used inside Qubes OS or do they use some other format? I expect them to work.
* (adrelanos) How to create the VM description file with internal network?

==== KVM OPEN ====

* (adrelanos) KVM is good because it's in the kernel.
** (anonymous) KVM is also bad because it's in the kernel. see qubes-os docs for why they chose Xen over it.
** (adrelanos) So it will be Xen...
* (adrelanos) Which user interfaces exist?
* (adrelanos) We should make a list off all features we need from KVM backend and from user interface (virt-manager). List the missing pieces. Track/create (if not already) the approprieate bug reports and feature requests.
* (espes) Note 'KVM' can refer to just the kernel tech or qemu-kvm, which was a fork of qemu using the kernel driver but has recently been merged into mainline qemu.

==== Qemu see status ====

* (adrelanos) STATUS: Unless someone researches it, not going to happen. If someone finds out, documents, it will be gladly added. Default Virtualizer will stay VirtualBox. Might accept alternative Qemu builds if someone is willing to maintain those builds. Open for development discussion. An anonymous user [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/c0090dde/ reported] in the forum, that it's working.
* (espes) Slow (but fast enough?, self-contained, portable) without optional KVM backend.
** (adrelanos) Needs Testing. Maybe fast enough on fast systems?
* (espes) Probably more secure than VirtualBox (no rotten kernel module)
* (adrelanos) [http://wiki.qemu.org/KQemu/Doc KQEMU is dead.] They now focus on KVM.
* (adrelanos) How is public scrutiny compared with VirtualBox? Do they have any enterprise or any other kind of customers?
* (espes) Probably less secure than a hardened bare-metal hypervisor (Xen, ESX, etc)
* (adrelanos) Deployability? How difficult is it for users to download and install everything?
* (adrelanos) Usability? How difficult is it for users to start, stop (, clone, delete, import, snapshot) the VMs? Graphical user interface?
* (adrelanos) Implementation: the Whonix build process initially create .img images, which seem to be useable by Qemu. There seems easy to support Qemu. Only the start command telling how much ram, which image to use etc. I think the most difficult part could become configuring the internal network between WG and WW.
* (adrelanos) General advice when trying to develop this: Try first to get an internal network without using Whonix, afterwards(!) apply the things you learned to Whonix.
* (adrelanos) Term for search engines: qemu internal network
* (adrelanos) Might be related: https://blog.cryptomilk.org/2007/07/12/qemu-kvm-internal-network-setup/

==== libvirt IMPOSSIBLE ====

* (adrelanos) Should check if the VirtualBox specific commands can be replaced with http://libvirt.org/. It is a wrapper for all virtualizer specific commands and offers one unified api. (Ubuntu Bug needs simple workaround: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2778638/libvirt-and-virtualbox-getting-started) In theory all virtualization platforms could be supported at once. At least for building from source choosing the virtualizers would be as simple as changing one option. That would make Whonix fairly virtualizer independent and very generic.
* (adrelanos) Libvirt is out of question. [https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html libvirt-users Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?] Libvirt does not (yet) abstract some commands Whonix depends on.

=== OPTIONALFEATURE Portable VirtualBox (like portableapps.com) LOOKING for contributor ===

* (adrelanos) Whonix can be equally as easy to use like the Tor Browser Bundle. There are adjusted versions for portability, such as vbox.me. Also when you google it, you find a lot of stuff about portable virtualbox. It would allow us to configure a package of VirtualBox portable, including T-G and T-W. The user would only have to start both and were done.
* (adrelanos) Can we trust [http://www.vbox.me/ vbox.me/]? (Did not look into it yet.)
* (adrelanos) UPDATE: [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023575.html coderman implicated] that we should make the final package as easy and secure as possible. Secure in meaning of, there should be no buttons were the user can potentially harm himself. (Such as adding a NAT/bridged network adapter to the T-W.)
* (adrelanos) Another option would be the VirtualBox core combined with PhpVirtualBox. Drawback: we also would have to deploy a webserver which PhpVirtualBox needs to function. Advantage: hacking PhpVirtualBox (disabling dangerous buttons) should be easier.
* (adrelanos) Or we can control VirtualBox through the command line interface only. A (compiled) windows batch file or linux shell script could be sufficient to start the T-G.ova and the T-W.ova, thus hiding most Virtualbox controls.

=== SECURITY Research: IP discovery through Tor Proxy LOOKING FOR CONTRIBUTOR ===

* (adrelanos) See torproject.org trac ticket #5928: task: Research: IP discovery through Tor behind isolated network for details.
* (adrelanos) Since May 2012, the Whonix project has neither the developers, time nor skill to do the research. Waiting for contributor.

== Host Operating System ==

=== SECURITY Whonix Host Operating System NEEDS_DISCUSSION ===

* (adrelanos) See also forum discussion: https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/1e64cfee/

=== FEATURE Whonix (USB) installer TODO NEEDS_CODE ===

* (adrelanos) The [[Pre Install Advice#Recommendation to use a dedicated host operating system|Pre Install Advice]] recommends to use a dedicated host operating system on external media just for running Whonix. Even when not using [[Physical Isolation]], this improves security a lot. Users should be more encouraged to do it.
* (adrelanos) The Whonix installer could install a host operating system to a USB disk and download the Virtual Machine images.
* (adrelanos) The host operating system on the USB disk should be fully encrypted.
* (adrelanos) I am not aware of any tools running on existing Windows/Linux/Mac, offering to install Debian on an encrypted USB hdd.
* (j0hn d03) This can help http://www.linuxliveusb.com/
* (adrelanos) Someone in the forum suggested https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Live_USB_creator - both don't support encryption. By the way we don't use this page anymore.

=== SECURITY MAC address in public networks OPEN NEEDS_DISCUSSION ===

* (adrelanos) We need to add instructions how to change mac addresses on bare metal, since it can't be done with VirtualBox. UPDATE, not exact, see below.
* (adrelanos) [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/MAC_address/ Tails MAC address]; [https://tails.boum.org/todo/macchanger/ Tails macchanger]
* (adrelanos) When using Whonix's bare metal Tor-Gateway in public networks, it might not be wise to use a fixed MAC, because Tor-Gateways's MAC address is public knowledge. That reveals the fact, the user is a Whonix user. Affects [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/BareMetalHints#anonymouswifiadapter anonymous wifi adapter]. Update: Also affected [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/BareMetalHints#anonymous3Gmodem anonymous 3G modem].
* (adrelanos) And a google search told me, that our current MAC addresses are unique to Whonix. No other results for them. We should pick two popular network cards.
* (anonymous) MAC addresses don't work like that, they are supposed to be unique, there are no &quot;popular&quot; addresses out there. What we need to do in the case of public networks is randomize on reboots.
* (adrelanos) Randomize without asking on reboot is not good, like Tails pointed out, that can warn admins. We have to educate Whonix users about this issue and they have to make that decision.
* (adrelanos) The default MAC address for non-public networks should include a popular vendor, followed by the &quot;unique&quot; part.
* (anonymous) Well, if we use a non-unique MAC this isn't really so much of an issue because you still have some deniability. If using standard VBox Whonix on public networks we need to tell users to change the MAC on the host!
* (adrelanos) Yes, a NIC from a popular vendor is just a minor thing. That's only a minimal improvement, in case some stupid application collects your MAC (for licensing stuff) and sends it somewhere.
* (adrelanos) The issue in public networks is more complicated. The first part of the MAC has to be a popular vendor and the second part to be random. (by [https://tails.boum.org/todo/macchanger/#index1h1 Tails design]) If they are twice in the same public network, they (depending on their threat model) shouldn't change their MAC. Changing the MAC inside the VM is of no help within public networks. MAC has to be changed on the host, that's the MAC the public network gets to see. Bare metal = host. They won't need special instructions.
* (adrelanos) Started documenting, [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/SecurityAndHardening#WhonixinpublicnetworksMACAddress Whonix in public networks / MAC Address]. UPDATE: may be revised. Sufficient for Whonix 0.2.0.
* (anonymous) Even according to Tails doc Whonix can do automatic randomization; it's not a live distro and therefore not suited for public PCs, the worry about non existing vendor IDs is therefore a lesser too. What we need, for 0.2, is a script that will configure Ubuntu/Debian to disable auto starting of interfaces at boot and another script that can be run automatically, if so desired, to change the MAC address of all attached NICs. I think Backtrack is configured that way.
* (adrelanos) This is a hard one. And the macchanger scripts would have to be applied on host (hard, startup scripts are operating system and even distro specific) or for bare metal, on T-G. Neither Whonix nor Tails are ready for this kind of adversary in public networks. We outlined that in hardening and may add a link to the readme as well. Imho for now we can't do much more than documenting. When not used in public networks, we don't have to tamper with the host's MAC (and should not, in order not to break working setups).
* (anonymous) this does not apply to t-g on bare metal, we control everything. Also currently we assume that Whonix is built and run on debian/ubuntu and scripts for this can be made cross distro and cross version compatible. I think there should be an optional function in the tor-gateway script for this
* (adrelanos) I am okay with a optional function, but I wouldn't know how to implement it.
* (anonymous) t-g on &quot;bare metal&quot; (no matter whether it's a VM itself or not) always needs a changed mac address, we should use the same as for the VM (and a 3rd for host if t-g runs in vbox?) Apparently it can be added in /etc/network/interfaces as &quot;hwaddress ether 00:00....&quot;). That should be default for bare metal. To prevent automatically bringing up new network interfaces I think all that's needed is to uncomment &quot;auto eth0&quot;, then manually bring up with &quot;sudo ifup eth0&quot;. Then in addition we should provide a script to randomize, optionally on boot: add &quot;pre-up macchanger -e eth0&quot; to the interfaces file. TODO: documentation, -baremetal flag for t-g.sh.
* (adrelanos) &quot;t-g on &quot;bare metal&quot; (no matter whether it's a VM itself or not) always needs a changed mac address&quot; - Why?
* (anonymous) As I understand it if one uses bridged mode on the t-g and connects via Ethernet the t-w will be able to see both MAC adresses, the virtual VBox one and the physical of the host. Though I did not tested that.
** (adrelanos) T-W should be only able to see eth1's MAC (internal network: Whonix). T-W should not be able to see eth0's MAC (NAT or bridged). If that were the case, out setup were broken. Why should T-W see eth0's MAC? Everything T-W does will either be filtered or redirected into a Socks-, Dns- or TransPort. If that were the case, this were worth a bug report against Tor client. We should see if your assumption is actually true before implementing it (for that reason).
** (anonymous) Not so fast. We got a bare Metal Whonix with a t-g in vbox and a t-w in vbox. The virtual eth0 of the t-w in bridged mode directly connects to virtual eth1 on the t-g (bridged mode) That's how it's supposed work. But in reality t-g connects to the physical NIC on the client host which is connected to the physical NIC on the gateway host, which is connected to the virtual eth1 on t-g. Who says t-w has no way of finding out the MAC of either physical NIC? I very much doubt that, there are all these broadcast and arp things going on. Now if we use NAT for both VMs what do they see? Only a virtual NIC of the Vbox NAT device, what's the MAC of that, can it be changed? Looks like 10.0.3.2 is the virtual gateway with 52:54:00:12:35:02 which isn't unique. good. So, should we switch to NAT now? But maybe I'm wrong and t-w can't read physical MAC addresses?
** (anonymous) Do you have a bare metal set up to test this on? I'm pretty sure if using bridged networking the t-w can actually directly connect to both systems the t-g and its host (as if it was directly connected to two different NICs). Consequently if that's true, the host allowed forwarding and t-w was misconfiguration or rooted one could circumvent tor.
** (adrelanos) No, I don't have a test environment yet, hopefully soon.
** (adrelanos) Okay, that all sounds quite scary. I haven't yet completely wrapped by head around it. Anything switching away from bridged networking sounds fine.
** (anonymous) note: that the host could potentially forward and bypass traffic doesn't depend on bridged being used or not. The t-g host needs to be secure in every case. bridged mode really only has implications on MAC fingerprinting.
* (adrelanos) eth1's MAC on T-G (internal network) should really be changed to &quot;0800272fcf44&quot;, but fixed. Then T-G VBox were equal T-G bare metal.
* (adrelanos) And while we are at it, anything against using uppercase for the MAC's? VBox converts to uppercase anyway.
** (anonymous) Linux tools default to lower case, if I copy and paste that's what you get :)
** (adrelanos) Shouldn't we convert to uppercase anyway?
** (anonymous) If you want to, it's just cosmetic
** (adrelanos) Not solely cosmetic, it prevents confusion if anyone cares to check. This part closed. Whole thread not.
** (anonymous) if you say so :P Add to documentation and then let's file it for now? This isn't high priority to automate.
** (adrelanos) Well, no, I am of course not happy with the outcome of the whole thread / problem with MACs. What is done, is the part of discussion about using uppercase for the MACs in build documentation. You said it's solely cosmetic and didn't disagree with uppercase. I'd prefer uppercase to prevent confusion (&quot;build documentation said low but in fact in is big, is that alright?&quot;)
* (adrelanos) Any suggestions for a fix for Whonix 0.2.0? Any suggestions for a long term fix?
** (anonymous) &quot;add to documentation&quot; = I think we should just '''document the changes needed to /etc/network/interfaces and leave it to the user to do it manually'''. '''Long term, T-G should probably auto-detect if it's run directly on bare metal or in bridged mode and always spoof the MAC address, disable eth0 networking on boot and offer a script to randomize.''' ... '''Further we need to take care of USB wifi/mobile network sticks.'''
* (anonymous) basic documentation is done. not much more I can do without a baremetal/Pi test set up.

=== SECURITY Wipe RAM panic script OPEN NEEDS_RESEARCH NEEDS_CODE ===

* (adrelanos) We recommend Linux for the host anyway. We also should provide and recommend a panic button. Upon pressing the panic button, the content of the RAM has to be securely wiped. (To ensure that any full disk encryption keys from RAM are lost and cold boot attacks are impossible.) Tails and Liberte Linux implemented it.
* (adrelanos) How I wish it to work: you start the script shortcut on the host, ram and master keys get deleted, system crashes, clean shutdown takes too long. Resources: [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=136283 arch forum]; google: site:www.saout.de/pipermail/dm-crypt/ cold boot attack ; [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/ tails]
* (anonymous) Tails and Liberté use kexec, they've researched it and I think we should follow. Both could be faster but they are the most thorough, erasing even most of the kernel memory. If the hardware supports it: http://www1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/tresor - The idea is nice. It's only a kernel patch. If it doesn't get supported upstream it's a bit difficult to make use of as kernel is updated.
* (anonymous) Tails and liberte do it differently and a quick glance over their sources didn't make it obvious to me how to make a simple stand-alone implementation. I could need help here.
* (adrelanos) Difficult to understand and implement for me, as it needs a custom initramfs and I haven't learned that yet. And we should recommend to implement it on the host, not so much point implementing it in VM. Tails implemented quite nice features, they always wipe at normal shutdown and also have panic key (bootmedium removed). The latter may not be possible for use (may be installed on internal hdd), therefore we should provide a panic button/script. Also here it would be better, if that feature were supported upstream &quot;apt-get install wiperam&quot; or something like that. Maybe it would help if there were a real project, someone else proving a project for this - haven't found one yet besides a lot forum discussion.
* (anonymous) check gentoo and arch wiki for how to do things manually in linux. Ubuntu/Debian automate a lot of tasks but when you are trying to do custom things they often get in your way and make it more complicated. We should ask Tails if they are interested in upstreaming their work or releasing it as a standalone .deb. After all this isn't just useful for Tails and other Tor projects but everyone who uses FDE.
* (adrelanos) [https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-June/001258.html Tails-dev Ram Wipe Script Upstream, any progress?] Bad news. &quot;No progress so far. It's still in my low-priority personal todo list.&quot; ... &quot;But anyway, given the current state of relative brokenness of this feature, I'd rather see it *fixed* first, else it does not make sense to seriously talk about packaging.&quot;
* (adrelanos) It's a part of host security. Nothing we have to solve. Adding some hints to hardening.
* (anonymous) this is important, let's fix this. Since there's been zero progress, we need to make more noise...
* (adrelanos) I don't feel I am skilled enough to implement it myself. This issue has not been fixed by the whole security community. I wouldn't know how we could. It's not related to Whonix, it's interesting for a much wider community using FDE. Dunno why such great things like wipe ram script and TRESOR are not already in upstream. Making noise... Well, good idea, we can post a feature request to Ubuntu Brainstorm, ask askubuntu, ask serverfault, Update: superuser.com. One at a time. Let's prepare a message. Update: Please edit the message at will. If it's done I'll post it, post a link here and delete the draft.
* (adrelanos) Update posted first one: http://askubuntu.com/questions/153245/how-to-wipe-ram-on-shutdown-prevent-cold-boot-attacks
* (adrelanos) There has been an answer. Looks somewhat too small/easy. Btw: there is no registration required.
* (anonymous) It doesn't free any kernel memory as booting into a new small kernel via kexec which is what Tails/Liberte is doing. Still, much better than not doing anything.
* (adrelanos) I think this one will be a hard one, if no one from Tails or Liberte Linux implements it. Most people in the forum discussion have not really seen the cold boot attack demonstration and don't know how long contents of the RAM can really be extracted. Therefore most people argue that this feature is nonsense. And if the undecided ones google, they find old discussions prior the cold boot attack demonstrations and think it's pointless. We really gotta ask a good questions to attract interest.
* (adrelanos) Moved to non critical tasks due to lack of discussion and since it's not really the core of Whonix. Encryption is host security, we recommend it but are not an encryption project. Don't worry, after 0.2 we can continue making noise by posting it somewhere else.
* (adrelanos) Waiting for result on http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18975/wipe-ram-on-shut-down-to-prevent-cold-boot-attack and finally maybe posting on Ubuntu brainstorm.
* (adrelanos) http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/30076/ # ARCHIVE Closed discussions are archived. Feel free to reopen, copy back here then.

=== SECURITY Whonix Internal Updater OPEN NEEDS_DISCUSSION ===

* (adrelanos) Updating Whonix from user perspective is still a mess.
** (adrelanos) They need to somehow backup their data, download huge images, delete the old images, import new images, get operating system updates, releases are infrequent...
** (adrelanos) If the torbrowser script breaks or they update they signing keys, manual instructions have to be provided as a hotfix, which involves terminal commands.
* (adrelanos) The updater should contain two branches, stable and development.
* (adrelanos) By the way, projects such as Whonix hosted on sourceforge.net are allowed to host an apt repository as long it's hosted in the file release system. (For example [http://sonar-pkg.sourceforge.net/ sonar] has one.)
* (adrelanos) How? a) Either Whonix must come closer to Debian, i.e. convert all Whonix configuration files into .deb packages and then host a repository on sourceforge. After installing Debian in a virtual machine users could even add the Whonix repository and run &quot;apt-get install whonix-gateway&quot; and get all the files they require. Disadvantage: porting Whonix to other operating systems becomes much more difficult.
* (adrelanos) b) A wrapper around git. The [[Dev/News|Whonix News File]] could include the latest recommended versions (testing and experimental). The git wrapper would checkout that version and overwrite all configuration files, which are changes in Whonix source. Difficulty: what if configuration files get deleted/moved or packages get removed? The developers would have to carefully add the required commands to it.
* (adrelanos) [http://man.cx/dpkg-maintscript-helper dpkg-maintscript-helper] may be useful for deleting or renaming configuration files if we decide to go the .deb way.
* (adrelanos) We made great progress packaging whonix as deb packages.

=== SOURCE CODE PACKAGING get tails_htp into Debian NEEDS_CODE ===

* (adrelanos) [[Dev/TimeSync|Whonix's Secure And Distributed Time Synchronization Mechanism]] depends on tails_htp. Let's get it into Debian.
* create an upstream github repository - done
* add patch, perhaps option to deactivates VirtualBox guest additions time sync (the few lines of code are already in Whonix)
* add patch, to run htpdate every hour at a random minute for continued time synchronization
* add patch, to use /usr/bin/curl instead of curl to circumvent uwt wrapper, because htpdate uses socks settings.
* make sure it could work in plain Debian without Tor, with Tor, in Tails and in Whonix
* talk about it with the Tails developers
* give the Tails developers git write access
* create a .deb
* get the .deb into Debian
* (adrelanos) Created a repository: https://github.com/adrelanos/sdwdate
* (adrelanos) Removed tails_htp from Whonix. Finished sdwdate. (Not in Debian. Making it a standalone package would still be a good task for some day, but we have a github ticket for more compartmentalization of Whonix.)

|description=Anonymize any Operating System! Your operating system tunneled through the Tor Anonymity Network! Create your Custom-Whonix-Workstation!
}}

= Introduction =
The Whonix Framework&lt;ref&gt;[[Technical_Introduction#Whonix_Framework]]&lt;/ref&gt; supports any operating system.

'''''Using a Whonix-Download-Workstation is easier and provides more Security out of the box!''''' It's your responsibility to get the same security features for a Whonix-Custom-Workstation, see [[Other_Operating_Systems#Security_Comparison:_Whonix-Download-Workstation_vs._Whonix-Custom-Workstation|Security Comparison: Whonix-Download-Workstation vs. Whonix-Custom-Workstation]] at the bottom of the page for details.

The Whonix-Gateway already supports torification of any operating system, including Microsoft Windows and others. As an transparent or isolating proxy, see below for more information.

= Windows-Whonix-Workstation =
XP, Vista and Windows 7 are are known to work behind Whonix-Gateway. While it's possible, it's not recommended and only for advanced users. This is because, there are issues with Windows. Those are not Whonix issues. Whonix developers can not fix those issues. One issue is, that Windows is closed source. Rather, Windows is affected by [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks] and other issues. For more information and depending on your security requirements, read the following chapters.

== Easy ==
{{VM Settings Easy Common}}

(5). Configure network:

For Windows 7 (similar in Windows XP): In Control Panel -&gt; Network and Sharing Center: click on &quot;Change adapter settings&quot; Right-click on local area connection &gt; properties In property window: double-click Internet Protocol Version 4, use the following settings:

&lt;pre&gt;
IP address 192.168.0.50
Subnet netmask 255.255.255.0
Default gateway 192.168.0.10
Preferred DNS server 192.168.0.10
&lt;/pre&gt;

(6). Download operating system updates.

== Easy ==
{{VM Settings Easy Common}}

(5). Configure network:

Open a Terminal and type.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces&lt;/pre&gt;

You only need to configure eth0:

&lt;pre&gt;# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface, leave as it is
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp
iface eth0 inet static
# increment last octet on additional workstations
       address 192.168.0.12
       netmask 255.255.255.0
       #network 192.168.0.0
       #broadcast 192.168.0.255
       gateway 192.168.0.10&lt;/pre&gt;
Open /etc/resolv.conf.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf&lt;/pre&gt;
and delete everything, then add

&lt;pre&gt;nameserver 192.168.0.10&lt;/pre&gt;
(6). Download operating system updates.

Debian based Linux, such as Ubuntu:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/pre&gt;

= More security =

Recommendations:

* Verify operating system installation CD, compare with sha256 hash or even better verify the gpg signature, if available.
* Install while the Virtual Machine has no internet connection.
* Set your username to ''user''.
* Disable Internet Time Syncing.
* Set your Time Zone to ''UTC''.
* Set up a static IP.
* In case you want to run more than one Whonix-Workstation at the same time, it's recommended reading the Introduction in the [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]] article.
* Read [[Security Guide]], [[Documentation]] and [[Design]] (which is Whonix-Example-Implementation-Workstation (based on Debian GNU/Linux) specific) and try to apply as much from it to Windows as possible.

= Even more security =

== General ==

Recommendations:

* Prevent [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks] by disabling Whonix-Gateway's Transparent Proxy feature. Instead use your Windows Whonix-Workstation behind an [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy Isolating Proxy]. See [[Stream Isolation]] for more information and instructions on how to disable the Transparent Proxy feature.
* Check your host clock out of band (use a watch or atomic clock).
* Set your host and your Workstation clock to show seconds as well. After booting the Whonix-Windows-Workstation, add a random skew to your clock, maybe +/- 1 to 30 seconds. Optimal values are still under investigation. For reference, see [[TimeSync|Whonix's Secure And Distributed Time Synchronization Mechanism]], it's Whonix-Example-Implementation-Workstation (based on Debian GNU/Linux) specific, but most information also applies to Windows. Since I am not aware of a tails_htp alternative for Windows, you have to do it manually.

== Conclusion ==

The Whonix-Download-Workstation is already preconfigured with all Whonix extra security features.

A Whonix-Custom-Workstation ''can be made'' (Your responsibility!) as secure as a Whonix-Download-Workstation. If you simply create &lt;ref&gt;Install or use a Live CD/DVD into Whonix-Workstation.&lt;/ref&gt; a Whonix-Custom-Workstation it has still ''some'' security advantages, for example full IP/DNS protocol leak protection, but ''not all'', for example it lacks Secure Distributed Network Time Synchronization. The details are listed in the table above.

[[Image:flash_leak_test_both_transport.png|Flash Leak Test both TransPort|thumb]]

= Introduction =

We explain the risks of browser plugins (flash etc.), discuss some alternatives and finally explain how to use browser plugins anyway in the best possible secure manner.

= Tor Browser =

For information about Tor Browser in general, see [[Tor Browser]].

= Warning not to use them =
{{mbox

Some popular plugins are non-Free, Closed Source software! &lt;br /&gt;

As [http://www.stallman.org/ Richard Stallman] puts it, Quote: &quot;[...] If you run a nonfree program on your computer, it denies your freedom; the main one harmed is you. [...]&quot;.  Read more, [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/is-ever-good-use-nonfree-program.html Is It Ever a Good Thing to Use a Nonfree Program?] It is [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html recommended] to avoid using non-Free software and to use [https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software Free Software] instead. Check if your browser plugin is Free Software before using it.
}}

Quoted the Whonix Features page &lt;ref&gt;[[Features]]&lt;/ref&gt;: &quot;''Java / JavaScript / flash / browser plugins / Malware &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware&lt;/ref&gt; / misconfigured applications cannot leak your real external IP.''&quot; &quot;''This is still not recommended as they may decrease anonymity (e.g. flash cookies) and often have security vulnerabilities. Some popular plugins are closed source. See [[Security in Real World|Whonix Security in real world]].''&quot;

Although it's not recommended, we don't want to withhold the knowledge from you how to use browser plugins.

IP leaks are not easily possible.&lt;ref&gt;Read [[Comparison_with_Others#Attacks|Attack on Whonix]] and/or [[Design]] for details on how much effort would be needed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concern against browser plugins can be broken down to:

1. Non-Free Software. See our warning Box above.

2. Linkability: browser plugins use can be probably correlated to the same [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonym]]. &lt;ref name=compare&gt;For an overview about Flash Tracking Techniques and why Whonix users are much better off than users who run Tor and proxifiers and/or custom firewall rules, see chapter [[Comparison_with_Others#Flash_.2F_Browser_Plugin_security|Flash / Browser Plugin Security]]&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Fingerprinting: browser plugins can probably leak lots of information about your (virtual) operating system (=Whonix-Workstation)

4. Security: some plugins have a history for remote exploits. More precise: the risk for your virtual operating system to get infected by trojan horses etc. is higher.

But anyway, of course you should look for alternatives first (see below), but if you insist on using browser plugins, an isolating/transparent proxy like Whonix is probably your best bet. &lt;ref name=compare /&gt;

= Avoiding browser plugins =

Avoiding browser plugins and flash is better than using them.

Note that there are alternatives to browser plugins. Most of the workarounds aren't a 100% complete, perfect drop in replacement, but perhaps it works sufficient for you (for example, if you only need youtube). Alternatives are html5, gnash, flash video replacer, flash video download or using a flash video download and convert online service. There are also applications worth checking, such as youtuberipper, ClipGrab, minitube, Totem with totem-plugins-extra, etc. Discussing the flash alternatives in details is beyond the scope of Whonix.

Also the Tails folks prepared a good list of Flash alternatives, see [https://tails.boum.org/todo/Flash_support Tails Flash support].

If you still want to use browser plugins or flash, read below.

= How to use Flash - EASY =
{{mbox
| type       = critical
| image      = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px|alt=warning against non-Free browser plugins]]
| text       = 
Adobe Flash is non-Free, Closed Source software! &lt;br /&gt;
Make sure you have read our [[Browser_Plugins#Warning_not_to_use_them|Warning not to use them]] above first!
}}

If you insist on using browser plugins anyway (read [[Browser_Plugins#Warning_not_to_use_them|warnings]] above), you can install new software &lt;ref&gt;Read [[Install Software|Software Installation on Whonix-Workstation]]&lt;/ref&gt; in Whonix-Workstation. Your best bet may be using the Tor Browser.

Your IP/location will still be hidden. Consider the plugin usage ''[[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous rather than anonymous]]''. This is the EASY chapter, which does not include all security considerations. For those, read the whole page.

If you are using any plugins such as Flash, it will be probably known to the exit relay, exit relay's ISP and website, that you are a Whonix user.

&lt;ref name=four&gt;Most &quot;plugins over Tor&quot; users probably use Mozilla Firefox and Flash on Microsoft Windows with a socksifier. They can be easily browser fingerprinted and probably even linked, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers] and [https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#oldtorbutton Tor Button FAQ].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=five&gt;That is because very few people use Tor Browser with plugins, which are routed through Tor. Also because Tor Browser was at Whonix build time manually configured to use a Tor's SocksPort (for stream isolation), while user-installed plugins will will be automatically routed Tor's TransPort. The SocksPort and the TransPort will go through different circuits and most times through different exit relays. That probably differs from the rest of the &quot;Plugins over Tor&quot; users group. For demonstration, see screenshot: [[Image:flash_leak_test.png|Flash Leak Test SocksPort and TransPort|thumb]] you'll see, that the Tor Browser and Flash have different Tor exit IP's. It's questionable if that particular difference could and should be fixed and if situation had improved afterwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=six&gt;See [[Tor_Browser#Change.2FRemove_Proxy_Settings|Change/Remove Proxy Settings]] for how to route Tor Browser through Tor's TransPort. Then both, Tor Browser and plugins would go through Tor's TransPort. This has been tested, see screenshot[[File:Flash_leak_test_both_transport.png|thumb]]. The question would be, if that would actually improve the situation talked about in earlier footnotes. There are probably only a very few using Tor Browser and plugins through the same circuit. (In a earlier footnote, it was mentioned, that they are still using Mozilla Firefox, even though that's even more discouraged.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Install Flash.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
&lt;/pre&gt;

(2) Additionally, it might make sense to install Firefox (Tor Browser) Add-On [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/ BetterPrivacy], which can be setup to delete Flash Cookies.

(3) Activate browser plugins in Tor Browser.

To activate browser plugins in Tor Browser &lt;ref&gt;Note that Tor Button in Tor Browser disables all plugins by the default settings. That decision is made by the Tor Browser developers, not by the Whonix developers. (Of course, the Whonix developers second their decision.)&lt;/ref&gt; right click on Tor Button -&gt; Preferences... -&gt; Security Settings -&gt; uncheck: Disable Plugins during Tor usage. You have to restart Tor Browser.

(4) Updating Flash

Each time there is a new version of flash, you should update.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo update-flashplugin-nonfree --install --verbose
&lt;/pre&gt;

= How to use other browser plugins =

Note that Tor Browser developers added a patch &lt;ref&gt;https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob/maint-2.2:/src/current-patches/firefox/0005-Block-all-plugins-except-flash.patch&lt;/ref&gt;, which blocks all plugins except flash. To use other plugins, read the more advanced guide below.

= How to use browser plugins - Advanced =

If you don't like to use Tor Browser, you could install the mainstream Firefox, Chromium, Flash etc. For a discussion whether this is good or bad for anonymity, see the &quot;More Security&quot; section below.

Firefox.

&lt;pre&gt;## In Debian, Firefox is called Iceweasel.
sudo apt-get install iceweasel&lt;/pre&gt;
Or Chromium.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install chromium-browser chromium-browser-l10n&lt;/pre&gt;
= How to use browser plugins - More Security =

== Read the EASY chapter above first ==

Read the EASY chapter above first

== Deactivate unneeded browser plugins ==

It's recommended to activate only plugins, you really use. On most browsers their is a pseudo URL 'about:plugins' to check which are activated. Go to Tor Browser -&gt; Tools -&gt; Plugins and deactivate all plugins, which you don't need, or even better, uninstall them.

== Separate Tor Browser or Separate Whonix-Workstation dedicated to browser plugins ==

For best security use [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers#TorBrowserbehindatransparentorisolatingproxy More than one Tor Browser behind an transparent or isolating proxy] or even better, [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots|multiple VM snapshots]] or [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].

== SocksPort vs TransPort ==

Using the easy instructions above will cause Tor Browser to go through SocksPort and browser plugins such as Flash to go through TransPort. It may or may not make sense to either force both through a SocksPort (difficult) or to force both through the TransPort, see footnotes.

&lt;ref name=four&gt;Most &quot;plugins over Tor&quot; users probably use Mozilla Firefox and Flash on Microsoft Windows with a socksifier. They can be easily browser fingerprinted and probably even linked, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers] and [https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#oldtorbutton Tor Button FAQ].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=five&gt;That is because very few people use Tor Browser with plugins, which are routed through Tor. Also because Tor Browser uses Tor's SocksPort (for stream isolation), while user-installed plugins will will be automatically routed Tor's TransPort. The SocksPort and the TransPort will go through different circuits and most times through different exit relays. That probably differs from the rest of the &quot;Plugins over Tor&quot; users group. For demonstration, see screenshot: [[File:Flash_leak_test.png|thumb]] you'll see, that the Tor Browser and Flash have different Tor exit IP's. It's questionable if that particular difference could and should be fixed and if situation had improved afterwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

If you insist on using it... For better security &lt;ref&gt;http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2012/12/msg00025.html&lt;/ref&gt; or if Flash from the Debian repository does not work for you, Flash can be downloaded directly from Adobe.

(1) Go to https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/

(2) choose Linux (32-bit)

(3) choose 11.2 for other Linux (.tar.gz) 32-bit

(4) click on the Download now button

(5) you will see

= DISCLAIMER =

== General ==

''''''DISCLAIMER:'''''' The authors accept NO responsibility for any leaks, faults, detection, incarceration, torture, etc; as a result of your use of Whonix. NO WARRANTY expressed or implied.

We have done our best to create this project, but we are not programmers, network experts, tor expert, lawyer, etc; Just a Tor user who have done extensive research on Google. Be careful, use your brain, trust no one but yourself.

== Whonix VPN disclaimer ==

You only have to read this chapter, when you are going to combine Whonix with a VPN.

Whonix is in no way affiliated with any VPN provider.

The mentioned VPN providers on other wiki pages have been chosen, because we found them, it was easy to register, no personal information were required and because it was free. Whonix developers do not review or rate VPN providers, that is beyond the Whonix project. You are welcome to post instructions for other free VPN services, which will be treated equally. In no way any provider is labeled as a good/bad choice.

Depending on what they were used for, they also fulfilled certain criteria, which are mentioned in the specific article. For example: TCP connection supported; not blocking UDP ports; OpenVPN supported, many other free providers offered only access through proprietary, closed source and/or windows-only clients.

Most websites recommend for choosing a good VPN:

1. Do not use free VPNs, as they observe you, log everything and sell you.

2. Leave no money trail, pay anonymously. (Bitcoin etc.) ([[Money|Anonymous Money page]])

3. Research their reputation, background, history, location.

4. Check their privacy policy and terms of service.

5. They shouldn't ask for any identifying information. (name, postal address, e-mail etc.)

6. The providers homepage is reachable over http'''s''' with a valid SSL certificate.

7. You can use GPG to mail them. ([[Software#encrypt-decrypt-sign-and-verify-text-using-openpgp-gnupg-frontend|gpg mail encryption chapter]])

8. They offer to use their service with a VPN software, which secure and Free Software&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software&lt;/ref&gt;, such as OpenVPN.

Use at your own risk.

= Whonix.org Privacy Policy =
The website whonix.org, takes your privacy seriously and collects as little as information as possible. IP logs are disabled, we are using apache mod-removeip &lt;ref&gt;https://we.riseup.net/debian/apache#mod_removeip&lt;/ref&gt;. If it becomes necessary (such as spamming or abuse), we may need to re-enable IP logging. 

In any case, we recommend visiting this website using the Tor Browser in Whonix or using the Tor Browser Bundle. Although we rent this server from a reputable server provider, but can't audit their logging policy.

A written privacy policy isn't worth much anyway, since its only privacy by policy. That is why anonymity preserving tools such as Whonix and Tor Browser have been created in the first place. They offer privacy by design.

|description=History of Whonix. TorBOX -&gt; aos -&gt; Whonix.
}}

= History of Whonix =

Originally called TorBOX, called aos (which stood for '''a'''nonymous '''o'''perating '''s'''ystem) in meanwhile and finally renamed to Whonix.

TorBOX didn't start as a software project. Originally it was only a wiki site. The goal was to simplify the instructions how to use Tor as a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy Transparent Proxy] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Fg0ru2Rm w]). '''Adrelanos''' was amazed by the idea, to have a (virtual) machine where all traffic is routed through Tor and where IP or DNS leaks are impossible with the additional benefit, that there are no proxy settings for any applications necessary anymore. Check the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX?version=1 first version of the torproject.org TorBOX wiki site] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Fg0uhbsR w]) how simple it looked like, that was on 2012-01-11 (2012 January 11).

Quickly other contributors improved the article. You can check that using [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX?action=history torproject.org's wiki history feature] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Fg0wldJ5 w]). The TorBOX wiki site grew steady in size, information and complexity. Given the complexity of the required steps, it was necessary to provide leak tests, which was done by '''smarm'''. '''Anonymous''' created a shell script to do the many steps in an automated way. '''Anonymous''' created the first downloadable TorBOX images as well. In the past we had separate articles for manual creation of TorBOX, building using the shell scripts and using the downloads. It became to much overhead to maintain the comprehensive manual instructions to build TorBOX while updating the shell scripts as well. The TorBOX developers agreed to drop the manual creation in favor of the shell scripts. Still, nothing got lost doing this transition. The full documentation, an explanation and justification, why each and any step is done was migrated into the shell scripts. Since all shell scripts were written in bash, anyone able to use the command line was still be able to read the bash script and to do the steps manually.

The shell scripts grew steady because more and more knowledge has been researched, more and more things had to be done to make TorBOX even safer or to add even more functionality. After the release of TorBOX 0.1.3 there was no one willing to create new images, because the process of creation was tiresome. Installing the operating system manually, putting the scripts into the virtual machines and running them for every improvement seemed boring and time consuming. The TorBOX developers agreed to make the build process fully automated. It became also clear, that TorBOX may no longer consist of only two shell scripts. The big scripts had to be spitted to many more files. Rather it became clear, that a wiki is no longer suited for lots of development related discussion and source code commits. Also a dedicated TorBOX website became required.

Andrew Lewman told adrelanos in private mail, that it would be better if TorBOX was renamed. Even though it was announced on the website that it's unaffiliated with the Tor project, people confused TorBOX with the Tor project. A new name for the project had to be found. In a rush adrelanos renamed to project to aos, which stud of anonymous operating system. The name was a suboptimal choice. Searching for it in search engines did not bring up any results because it was already used for too many other things. Also a name starting with a small character is suboptimal, because at the beginning of a sentence it must be a big character. Adrelanos asked on the tor-talk mailing list for ideas for an anonymous operating system project and got lots of suggested. Whonix was suggested and one of the very few unused terms in search engines, therefore it was chosen as new project name by adrelanos. The name is a combination of two words, who and nix. Who as in who and nix as in nothing. You could also think of it as &quot;no one&quot;. Whonix should be pronounced &quot;Who Nix&quot;. It seems many people don't expect the &quot;W&quot; in Whonix the be silent.

== Source for downloaded image ==

The scripts used to build a certain downloaded version of a TorBOX-Gateway or TorBOX-Workstation image can be '''also''' found in the VM at /usr/share/doc/torbox (in TorBox 0.2 at /usr/local/bin/tor-*) and through the wiki history.

== TorBOX 0.1.3 (old, outdated, released) ==

TorBOX 0.1.3, which was '''released''' as build from source and download version.

It no longer builds, due to breaking changes from Tor 0.2.2 to Tor 0.2.3.

There was also an attempt by '''anonymous''' to build TorBOX 0.2.0-debootstrap. It has been dropped because there were too many issues. The open issues are noted within the files. '''Never released.''' If anyone wants to continue working on it that's certainly possible, let's discuss this on Whonix/Dev then.

Based on TorBOX 0.2.0-debootstrap, there was also an attempt by '''adrelanos''' to create TorBOX 0.2.0-no-network-while-preseeding, which failed. '''Never released.''' (The goal was to save time while installing/preseeding.)

'''2012-09-10'''

Whonix '''ALPHA''' version '''0.4.5''' has been released and is ready for testing. Many usability bugs have been fixed. Security was further and slightly improved. Since it's an alpha version, there can be further unknown bugs. Known bugs are on the [[Download]] page. Changelog: [[Changelog]] Release announcement: [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-October/025921.html tor-talk Mailing List]; [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2012/10/msg00007.html Debian Derivatives Mailing List]; [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=whonix-devel Whonix Devel Mailing List]

'''2012-28-09'''

Whonix '''ALPHA''' version '''0.4.4''' has been released and is ready for testing. There some usability bugs inside, but workarounds are available in this readme. Since it's an alpha version, there can be further unknown bugs.

I did not want to delay this release any further. The mess with multiple project names and websites had to come to an end. I've seen people loosing interest in open source projects, because there was no visible progress. This is no vaporware. Changelog: [[Changelog]]

'''2012-09-05'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; A bug in Whonix 0.2.1 when trying to update Tor has been [https://sourceforge.net/p/torbox/discussion/general/thread/e938932d/ reported]. The bug has been confirmed by Whonix developer adrelanos. Thanks to the anonymous user for reporting the bug and for testing the workaround! You can find the workaround under [[Deprecated#Updating Tor|Updating Tor]].

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; I am still having problems with the new webhost. Aos development made steady progress (see in [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix git] if you are interested). The project is still very active and I am still interested and going to develop it further. One the webhost problem has been fixed, the 0.3.0 will be released.

'''2012-07-17'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Rebranding. '''aos''' is the new project name. The process of rebranding is ongoing. Also all links have to be renamed. That will be done as soon as a new home for Whonix has been found.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; A Whonix (previously called Whonix) source code 0.2.1 is now on [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix github]. The source code will be polished so it will be easier to understand, maintain and contribute.

'''2012-07-16'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Whonix 0.2.1 has been released. It's Alpha quality software. There were no testers besides '''proper'''. You can download it. While this release contains many security enhancements, new minor usability bugs have been introduced. See [[Changelog]] for a comprehensive list of changes and known issues. '''adrelanos''' decided to release this even with the minor bugs since the security improvements are important. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The gnome-terminal has a minor bug, at startup the it's black on black, therefor you can't see anything. Simply change the colors manually.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; '''proper''' has a new pseudonym, '''adrelanos'''.

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Due to [https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq.html.en trademark issues], Whonix must be rebranded. Whonix needs a new name, and a new home, a new website. Stay tuned for updates.

'''2012-07-14'''

Whonix 0.2.1 will come out soon. Before officially releasing it, I'd like to have a few testers. If you are interested, please contact adrelanos a-t riseup do-t net.

'''2012-06-14'''

A bad news and a good news. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Unfortunately, the upcoming download version, Whonix 0.2.0, will not be functional on older hardware with non-PAE CPU's.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Fortunately, users with non-PAE CPU's, will still be able to build Whonix 0.2.0 from source. The situation may improve in future. The [[FAQ]] has been updated.

'''2012-06-02'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The latest TorButton update may break Tor Browser within Whonix. We'll post soon an update with a solution. The Readme explains how you can update Tor Browser.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; A bug crashing Whonix has been [http://ra.fnord.at/2011/05/easy-and-secure-anonymous-internet-usage/ reported offsite]. It happens when you try to run Whonix on older hardware, which does not support PAE. A new [[FAQ#Whonix crashes because of PAE?|FAQ entry]] with a interim solution has been posted. The bug will be fixed in Whonix 0.2.0. UPDATE: Unfortunately will only partially fixed, see news above.

'''2012-05-29'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The New Identity button of Tor Button in Tor Browser with Whonix is defunct. See [[Tor Browser#New Identity Button]] for an explanation why, what the New Identity button does and for a workaround.

'''2012-05-21'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; New article: All about [[Browser Plugins]] (such as Flash) in conjunction with Whonix.

'''2012-04-25'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; New optional feature. You can use a Secondary DNS resolver (Optional Feature).

'''2012-04-24'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; New optional feature. There is now a limited workaround for Tunneling UDP over Tor using VPNs.

'''2012-04-10'''

We have a bunch of new/updated articles/stuff. Here is a selection. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; new: Rudimentary Whonix Support for Other Anonymizing Networks. (People who are only interested in Tor, do not have to read.)

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; updated: Whonix/SecurityAndHardening.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; new: Whonix/Trust.

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; updated: Tunneling Proxy/SSH/VPN through Tor (Tor -&gt; Proxy/SSH/VPN).

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; new: A Free example VPN working with Whonix for testing purposes.

&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; new: Tunneling UDP over Tor (Update: see news)

&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Optional new feature: Hide your Whonix usage / Torify the Whonix-Gateway

&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Dev only: Hardened Gentoo based Whonix-Gateway

'''2012-04-02'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; '''Critical issue''' with /var/lib/tor for all users who downloaded the Whonix Download Binary images 0.1.3. Users who manually configured Whonix or used build from source are not affected.

On your Whonix-Gateway. 1. If you were using hidden services, backup your keys (/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/). 2. Execute the following:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo -i 
service tor stop
rm -r /var/lib/tor/*
service tor start
exit&lt;/pre&gt;
This will delete the content of the Tor data directory /var/lib/tor. Technical background: the Tor consensus and your [https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards entry guards] are stored there. These should not be shared along all Whonix users.

'''2012-03-25'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Binary images for Whonix 0.1.3 are now available! These are affected by the critical issue above.

'''2012-03-24'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; All users should update to 0.1.3! Users of Whonix 0.1.* can update using the update script. Users of Whonix versions prior the introduction of version numbers should reinstall following our build instructions or Physical Isolation instructions. Update: or download the latest ready-made images.

'''2012-03-22'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Whonix has now a logo. Thanks to XJ!

'''2012-03-06'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Identity correlation through circuit sharing (Update: This is now closed, there is nothing we can do about till the current alpha version of Tor becomes stable; Update 2: Whonix is already working with the current Tor alpha and prepared for the next Tor stable, see Whonix-Gateway.sh.)

'''2012-03-03'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Alpha builds available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/torbox/files/

'''2012-02-16'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This is resolved in the latest version of Whonix. Resolved in Whonix 0.1.3 and above. Only important prior Whonix 0.1.3. It would be prudent if all Whonix users would use the same time zone, as some applications do leak it, this hasn't been advised earlier. Do this on your Whonix-Workstation and on your Whonix-Gateway. Type in console

&lt;pre&gt;sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata&lt;/pre&gt;
then choose etc (at the bottom) and then choose UTC.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; new: Hosting hidden services

'''2012-01-11'''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Project started. [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX?version=1 Historical very first version].

|description=Security Advice Before Installing Whonix for Better Security
}}

= Pre Install Advice =

== General ==
Whonix with its default settings [[Comparison with Others#Security|may]] provide better protection than Tor alone. You can make it even more secure. It depends on how much you are willing to read, think about and practice with the procedures. See [[Documentation]].

== Warnings ==

Make sure you have already read the [[Warning]] page.

== On your host operating system ==

=== Tor Browser Bundle ===

It is recommended to always have the latest release of [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en Tor Browser Bundle] installed on your host. A great way to learn the basics about Tor.

The Tor Browser Bundle is great for testing if you live in either a censored area or not, if Tor is either blocked by your ISP or not. When you need (private) (obfuscated) bridges for the Tor Browser Bundle, you will need them for Whonix as well. (See [[Bridges#private and obfuscated bridges]].)

If you can not get the Tor Browser Bundle to work, you will most certainly not get Whonix to work either. And if some day Tor Browser in Whonix shouldn't work anymore or updating is broken, you can still use the Tor Browser Bundle to visit the Whonix Homepage.

== Host Security ==

=== Introduction ===

If the host is compromised by Malware&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware&lt;/ref&gt; so is every virtual machine with Whonix, Tor and all anonymous communication. In essence, Malware can see your desktop, everything you do, type, send, receive, etc.

Antivirus products and personal firewalls&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_firewall&lt;/ref&gt; are '''not''' drop in solutions for a secure host. Malware often stays undetected. Polymorphic code&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_code&lt;/ref&gt; and Rootkits&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit&lt;/ref&gt; pretty much render Antivirus products helpless. Personal firewalls often get circumvented.

The '''only''' promising approach is not to get infected by Malware in the first place. Once malicious code is on a system, it's next to impossible to contain. Not saying Antivirus scanning and firewalls are useless. They are not. Refer to them as your very last line of defense. If you ever find malware on your system, which is not a false positive, it only demonstrates, that your precautions didn't work. It is the precautions that matter (hardening, secure host operating system, using signed software, etc.), not the detection.

=== Recommendation to use a dedicated host operating system ===

You are advised to use a dedicated host operating system just for hosting the Whonix Virtual Machines. Should your regular every day operating system be already compromised, then Whonix could not provide any additional protections. It's best to have one dedicated host operating system, which is only used to host Whonix.

=== Recommendation to use Whonix on External Media ===

No one stops you from installing the host operating system(s) required for Whonix on external disks such as USB, FireWire, eSATA, etc. You can improve security by installing Whonix's host operating system(s) on a dedicated disk(s). That reduces the risk that any other operating system(s) of yours infecting Whonix's host operating system. You can remove and hide the Whonix disk(s) while you're not using them.

You can use any guide on the web explaining how to install Linux on USB. There are no Whonix specific differences other than, after you finished that, you install VirtualBox and Whonix.

=== Recommendation to use your own host ===
It is recommended to only use Whonix on computers you own. Which are not shared with others. Other users even if you trust them may not be equally educated about computer security. They just need to make one mistake. Once your computer is compromised, Whonix can't provide any protection anymore.

Needless to say, hosting Whonix in the cloud, on a foreign server you do not physically control, on a VPS etc. is recommended against, because the owner of that machine can see everything you do.

=== Recommendation to use a dedicated host ===
If you want to go even one step further on the security ladder, you are advised to use a dedicated computer just for hosting Whonix. A machine which you only use for using Whonix. Dedicated within the meaning of using a second/extra host operating system(s), which you never use(d) for anything else.

=== Firmware Updates ===
'''This chapter is general security advice and unspecific to Whonix.'''

These are just a pointers, because due the hardware and host operating system specificness and the difficulty of the topic, this is outside the scope of Whonix documentation. These may not be the most suitable links and you may have to research the topic on your own.

This includes [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS BIOS] [http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/BIOS_Update updates], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_blob non-free] drivers or [http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/firmware-linux-nonfree firmware] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode processor microcode] [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Microcode updates] (on Debian systems, depending on your processor, either the [http://packages.debian.org/jessie/intel-microcode intel-microcode] or the [http://packages.debian.org/jessie/amd-microcode amd-microcode] package).

It may or may not improve security to get the latest updates. One one hand, you may fix vulnerabilities. On the other hand, an update may introduce a new backdoor. It is not really clear. If you know examples for one or the other, please edit this chapter. See also the thread on the debian-security mailing list [http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2013/09/msg00027.html How secure is an installation with with no non-free packages?] As an end user, using common [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software non-Free] (as in Freedom, not price) hardware, not using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software Free] hardware ([http://www.lemote.com/en/products/Notebook/2010/0310/112.html Lemote Yeeloong Notebook maybe?]), you unfortunately have to blindly trust the hardware producer anyway, so it might be better to get the non-Free updates.

=== Windows Hosts === 
'''Short''': &lt;br /&gt;
You are much better off using alternative host operating systems, such as GNU/Linux. If you are using Windows...

'''Long''': &lt;br /&gt;
Microsoft silently updates users' machines even if that runs counter to their wishes and they have Windows Update disabled. &lt;ref&gt;http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/09/microsofts_stealth_update_come.html &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/confirmation-of-stealth-windows-update/779&lt;/ref&gt; 

Windows as a host system is unsuitable for anonymity due to the large number of software that phones home that comes included in a default install and the leaks that result from this. &lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks#Windows&lt;/ref&gt; Additional privacy risks not covered in the article have been introduced as part of the Windows 8. They include the smartscreen filter which reports to Microsoft what software you are running on your computer. &lt;ref&gt;http://log.nadim.cc/?p=78&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a kill switch that can allow Microsoft (or any one with an exploit for this mechanism) delete programs on your machine without your consent. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2400985,00.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Before patching Windows, Microsoft is known to consult with intelligence agencies about which security holes before they tell the public about them or fix them. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130614/02110223467/microsoft-said-to-give-zero-day-exploits-to-us-government-before-it-patches-them.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Since the NSA also buys security holes from other companies &lt;ref&gt;https://threatpost.com/nsa-bought-exploit-service-from-vupen-contract-shows/102314&lt;/ref&gt; and uses them to gain unauthorized access in computer systems &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity&lt;/ref&gt;, it is reasonable to assume, that the NSA also uses information supplied by Microsoft and that therefore Windows users are at higher risk.

Microsoft update used weak cryptographic verification. The CMU Software Engineering Institute said about MD5 in 2009 about MD5 it &quot;should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use&quot; &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#cite_note-11&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Flame malware exploited the weaknesses in MD5 to fake a Microsoft digital signature. &lt;ref&gt;http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-crypto-breakthrough/&lt;/ref&gt;

If you insist on using a Windows host... Was Windows installed from legitimate media? Not some pirated iso found on the net that could include malware. You shouldn't have any pirated software, this usually involves running unverified, possibly malicious binary cracks or key generators. 

Stick to renowned Open Source software, such as Firefox, Gimp, 7-zip, Libre Office, etc., which is more unlikely to contain malicious code. You should only download over https (SSL) and even better check the gpg signatures.

=== GNU/Linux Hosts ===

Using GNU/Linux on the host and only using in-repository software is automatically gpg signed and installed from the distributor's repositories by the package manager. This is much safer than downloading stuff from the web like you have to do as a Windows user.

=== Which host operating system do you recommend? ===

Briefly: Debian GNU/Linux is a reasonable compromise of security and usability (popularity, documentation). For extra security tips for download, verification and installation see [[Debian|Debian Tips]].

Longer: There are of course other options. See [[Dev/Operating_System#Why_don.27t_you_use_.3Cyour_favorite_most_secure_operating_system.3E_for_Whonix.3F | &quot;Why don't you use &lt;your favorite most secure operating system&gt; for Whonix?&quot;]].

=== LAN/Router Security ===

In case Whonix-Gateway would be ever compromised, you should know that it can theoretically access any computer in your local network. Therefore, if you're the admin of your home network, it's recommended to lock down the web interface of your home router, i.e. installing the latest firmware with latest security patches and using a secure password.

=== Host Firewall ===

Having a simple host firewall (gufw - Uncomplicated Firewall&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall&lt;/ref&gt; on Debian), denying all incoming ports, is recommended as well.

On the host, on Debian.

1. Install gufw.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install gufw
&lt;/pre&gt;

2. Start gufw

&lt;pre&gt;
gufw
&lt;/pre&gt;

3. Press unlock. Enter password.

4. Press enable.

5. Settings: Incoming: Deny Outgoing: Allow

=== Microphone ===
Does your computer or notebook have microphone? You could have a built-in one, but just never noticed - mute it, just in case. This chapters only applies to non-USB microphones, not to USB microphones.

Microphones connected to your host get available to Virtual Box virtual machines such as Whonix-Workstation. {{Code2|Virtual Box does not yet have a feature to disable microphones inside virtual machines.}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12026&lt;/ref&gt; If your Whonix-Workstation ever gets compromised by malware, an adversary could eavesdrop. Unless you plan to use [[Voip]] inside Whonix-Workstation, it's recommended to mute your microphone in your host operating system's audio settings. And even if you plan to use [[Voip]] sometimes, you should mute and possibly unplug your microphone after use.

External microphones should be unplugged, that's even safer. If its a built-in microphone and in case you decided to disable your microphone, you can also check in BIOS, if the microphone can be disabled. Removing built-in microphones may be a bit more difficult, but if you have the skills to remove it, go for it. Obviously, a host without any microphones, can not eavesdrop even in case the host is compromised.

=== Webcam ===
Does your computer or notebook have webcam? You could have a built-in one, but just never noticed - check your computer's datasheet and operating system's hardware manager.

Unless you plan to use a webcam inside Whonix-Workstation, it's recommended to disable or possibly remove your webcam. And even if you plan to use a webcam sometimes, you should disable and possibly unplug your webcam after use.

External webcams should be unplugged, that's even safer. If its a built-in webcams and in case you decided to disable your microphone, you can also check in BIOS, if the webcam can be disabled. Removing built-in webcams may be a bit more difficult, but if you have the skills to remove it, go for it. Alternatively, cover it up. Obviously, a host without any webcams, can not record even in case the host is compromised.

== Whonix information ==

=== MAC Address ===

==== Status of MAC Address chapter ====

No one has a good answer for this problem yet - not Whonix, Tails, Liberte Linux or the Tor Browser Bundle. It's still an open research problem. This chapter will give you all existing information.

==== Introduction ====

First of all, you should know that all network cards, both wired and wireless, have a unique identifier stored in them called their {{Code2|MAC address}}&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&lt;/ref&gt;. This address is actually used to address your computer on the local network, but it will never get out on the Internet so people can not use it to trace you. &lt;ref&gt;Unless your computer is infected with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware Malware] looking for this number.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other computers on the network could log it, which then would provide proof that your computer have been connected to that network. But if you are using an untrusted, public network, you should consider {{Code2|spoofing}}&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing&lt;/ref&gt; it.

==== Using your home connection ====

Changing your MAC address is not required.
However, when not using a VM, your physical MAC address could be revealed in case of a browser exploit. If you are already under suspicion, this would eventually provide proof of your identity.

Changing the MAC address at least requires root access to find out the real physical address.
(Note: This has to be tested)

==== Using a public computer (e.g. in a library, Internet-cafe) ====

The MAC address should not be changed, as it may bring undesired admin attention and/or simply forbid access to the Internet.

==== Using a personal computer (e.g. a laptop, wherever it happens) in a public network ====

The MAC address should be changed, and /var/lib/tor/state should be removed so that a new set of guards is selected.

Rather the admin may or may not find out, that you are using Tor. That depends on your configuration, i.e. perhaps you are using obfsproxy or you tunnel your traffic SSH/VPN, and on the adversary's skills.

The MAC address and being a Tor user, depending on your personal threat model, might be a risk visiting that public network (again).

If you are going to use the same public network again, you have to decide, depending on your threat model, if you are going to use the very same MAC address (and set of guards) or if you are going to create a new MAC address. In case you suspect that the admin has seen you and logged the MAC, perhaps you shouldn't change the MAC, since this could be appear suspect. If you believe that public network is so public, that no one has seen you, you might decide to use a new MAC address (popular vendor ID, random/unique second part) each time you stop by.

For more discussion on that rather difficult topic, see [[Dev/MAC]].

==== Random MAC address ====

Using a random MAC address is not recommended. While this might sufficiently confuse some adversaries, it won't defeat skilled adversaries. If you are using a random MAC address, it might happen that the vendor id part of the MAC address is non-existent. Even if it was existent, you might end up with a vendor id, which has either never been used or never been used in decades. If you are going to spoof your MAC, you have to use a popular vendor id.

The initial second part of the MAC address may be random/unique.

Unfortunately, we can't yet provide detailed instructions on how to create such appropriate MAC addresses. Research is still ongoing.

The reason why MAC changing is not always enabled is that it might cause problems on some networks.

==== Auto-connect issue ====

Apart from the difficulty creating such an appropriate MAC address, there are also technical hurdles. All the care creating the MAC does not help, if you boot your computer and it instantly connects to the public network and spills your MAC address. For Virtual Machine users: your host operating system most likely automatically connects (updates, perhaps time sync). For Physical Isolation users: Whonix-Gateway automatically connects to Tor after start.

Also if you plug in a wifi stick, it might happen, they automatically try to connect and spill your MAC.

==== Changing MAC address ====

'''''TODO''''': test and expand, please help!

&lt;u&gt;(0)&lt;/u&gt;

'''Get Macchanger'''
&lt;pre&gt;
su
apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install macchanger
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;u&gt;(0.1)&lt;/u&gt;

'''Changing MAC'''

if instructions 1+ below don't work, you can use the following to manually change MAC for your device (eth0, wlan0, etc.): 
&lt;pre&gt;su
ifconfig wlan0 down
macchanger -a wlan0
ifconfig wlan0 up
&lt;/pre&gt;
It might also work without macchanger:
&lt;pre&gt;su
ifconfig wlan0 down
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE
ifconfig wlan0 up
&lt;/pre&gt;
Or, using iproute2 commands:
&lt;pre&gt;
ip link set down wlan0
ip link set wlan0 address 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE
ip link set up wlan0
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;u&gt;(1)&lt;/u&gt;

'''Standard-Download-Version users'''

Edit ''/etc/network/interfaces'' on the host.

'''[[Physical Isolation]] users'''

Edit ''/etc/network/interfaces'' on Whonix-Gateway

&lt;u&gt;(2)&lt;/u&gt;

Below &quot;''iface eth0 inet dhcp''&quot; Add

&lt;pre&gt;hwaddress ether 00:00....&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;u&gt;(3)&lt;/u&gt;

To automatically randomize the MAC address on boot (if you want this?) add

&lt;pre&gt;pre-up macchanger -e eth0&lt;/pre&gt;
instead.

&lt;u&gt;(4)&lt;/u&gt;

To prevent automatically bringing up new network interfaces I think all that's needed is to uncomment

&lt;pre&gt;auto eth0&lt;/pre&gt;
Then manually bring up with

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ifup eth0&lt;/pre&gt;

|description=Connection Schema: user -&gt; proxy/VPN/SSH -&gt; Tor
}}

== Introduction ==

'''user -&gt; proxy/VPN/SSH -&gt; Tor'''

Read first: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor Plus VPN or proxy] and [[Whonix:General_disclaimer#Whonix_VPN_disclaimer|Whonix VPN disclaimer]].

Sometimes you are '''forced to use a proxy or VPN''' to make outgoing connections, some ISP's force you, or you are in a LAN with a proxy (router), or in a corperate environment.

A proxy, VPN or SSH can also be possibly

* '''used to circumvent Tor blocks''' or to
* '''hide the fact you are using Tor''', in that case make sure you have read [[Hide Tor and Whonix from your ISP]].

VPN and SSH are preferred choice, as they support secure encryption between you and them. It's a question, how much you can trust the server, they'll see, that you are using Tor, but thanks to Tor, they won't see what you are doing. If you use your own server in a safe country, while you are in a dangerous country, that's probably your best bet. Anyway, not so many people seem to do use a tunnel before they connect to Tor, therefore it's not so well tested, do not rely on it too much.

If nothing above applies for you, skip this section.

== Tunnel Tor through proxy ==
'''user -&gt; proxy -&gt; Tor'''

Tor natively supports proxy settings.

On Whonix-Gateway:

Open your {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
&lt;/pre&gt;

Depending on your proxy configuration, add the settings you'll need to your {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}. For more information on these settings, have a look in the [https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en Tor manual] and read the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorFAQ#MyInternetconnectionrequiresanHTTPorSOCKSproxy. FAQ].

&lt;pre&gt;
HTTPProxy host[:port]
HTTPProxyAuthenticator username:password
HTTPSProxy host[:port]
HTTPSProxyAuthenticator username:password

Socks4Proxy host[:port]

Socks5Proxy host[:port]
Socks5ProxyUsername username
Socks5ProxyPassword password

FascistFirewall 0|1 

ReachableAddresses ADDR[/MASK][:PORT]… 
ReachableDirAddresses ADDR[/MASK][:PORT]… 
ReachableORAddresses ADDR[/MASK][:PORT]… 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Note:''' You need to use the IP instead of the hostname (proxy.example.com). If you don't know the IP of your proxy, please run {{Code|nslookup proxy.example.com}} (replace proxy.example.com with the hostname of your actual proxy) in a terminal (Konsole) on your host operating system. Using IP instead of hostname might cause subtle fingerprinting issues, see &lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/94&lt;/ref&gt; for more information.

== Tunnel Tor through SSH ==
''user -&gt; SSH -&gt; Tor''

'''This section is not fully tested/complete. Please give feedback if it worked for you.''' This doesn't seem to be very popular, no one ever asked about it in over one year.

This chapter is about tunneling Tor through a SSH tunnel.

Setting up the VPN tunnel could be either done on the host or inside Whonix-Gateway.

1. First we have to install the ssh client.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ssh&lt;/pre&gt;

2. Then be sure that your SSH connection itself is working well. SSH to your ssh server using.

&lt;pre&gt;ssh yourusername@your.ssh.server&lt;/pre&gt;

3. It's recommended to set up public key authentication.

(TODO: how to create a private and public key)

&lt;pre&gt;cd /home/yourusername&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;mkdir .ssh&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;nano authorized_keys&lt;/pre&gt;

Paste line beginning with {{Code|ssh-rsa ...}} (your public key) (TODO: how to create that line).

4.
Terminate SSH connection.

&lt;pre&gt;exit&lt;/pre&gt;

Login again using public key authentication. (TODO: how to do that)

5. When that is working install your favorite text mode browser, for example.

&lt;pre&gt;apt-get install lynx&lt;/pre&gt;

And test if the shell's external internet connection is working. Try

&lt;pre&gt;lynx check.torproject.org&lt;/pre&gt;

You're done with the per-requriements.

Exit your shell.

&lt;pre&gt;exit&lt;/pre&gt;

6. Now we will tell the SSH client to start a socks5 proxy server listening on localhost 127.0.0.1 port 1080. The following command has to be run in background (TODO: add line how to do that) on each start up, before Tor starts (TODO: to which file, to do that). It would be wise to activate public key authentication (TODO: how to add private key to use public key authentication).

&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -D 1080 your.ssh.server
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we have to tell Tor to use the new local ssh server.

Open your {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
&lt;/pre&gt;

And add.

&lt;pre&gt;
## In case SSH tunnel has been setup from Whonix-Gateway.
Socks5Proxy 127.0.0.1:1080

## In case SSH tunnel has been setup on the host.
#Socks5Proxy IP:PORT
&lt;/pre&gt;

7. (TODO: if running inside Whonix-Gateway, probably new firewall rules are required.)

8. We are done, from now on, Tor will connect through the SSH server.

== Tunnel Tor through VPN ==

=== Introduction ===

'''user -&gt; VPN -&gt; Tor'''

There are too many different VPN protocols. Too many to add all of them to this guide. However, at least adding OpenVPN would be worth it.

If you are using VPN not,

* '''because you are forced to use VPN by your ISP''', but
* want to '''add an additional layer of protection''', or
* to '''hide the fact that you are using Tor''', in that case make sure you have read [[Hide Tor and Whonix from your ISP]]

then be sure, that your VPN software is secure (ex: use OpenVPN, not pptp).

=== Use a Fail Closed Mechanism ===

This is not a Whonix specific problem. It is a general problem with VPNs. Most users are simply not aware of it. VPN's generally fail open. VPN servers and VPN software can occasionally break down without announcement. This means, if the VPN is unreachable, connections breaks down for whatever reasons and so on, in most cases, you can continue to connect to the internet without the VPN.

In case of Whonix you would be left to the protections provided by Tor. Whonix-Workstation will seamlessly continue to make &quot;direct&quot; connections through Tor once the VPN breaks down. If you are using the VPN only to circumvent the censorship of Tor, you may not care so much. On the other hand, if you believe a VPN improves your security, it would be rational to make sure, the VPN is always used instead only most of the time.

If you want to enforce, that the VPN gets always used, see [[VPN-Firewall]].

=== How ===

If you are forced to use a VPN server or if you are already using a VPN server, you most likely know how you can connect to it.

You can either add the VPN on the host. Whonix-Gateway will be tunneled through it.

Or you can add the VPN into Whonix-Gateway. In that case you must know how to connect to your VPN server from the linux command line. (TODO: Any new firewall rules required?)

When your VPN is properly set up, all your connections are forced through the VPN first. If you start Tor on top of that, tunneling Tor through the VPN will work.

See also [[TestVPN|Free example VPNs working with Whonix for testing purposes]].

|description=Avoid your Internet Service Provider from finding out, that you are Tor user.
}}

== Introduction ==

Whonix users are most likely Tor power users. They are more paranoid than normal Tor users. And adversaries might ask themselves why. Whonix users most likely host [[Hidden Services]] or do other fancy stuff over Tor.

Depending on how restricted your area is and how paranoid you are, you may want to hide the fact from your provider, that you are a Whonix and/or Tor user.

{{mbox
| type       = notice
| image      = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = Hiding the fact that you are using Whonix is relatively easy, because Whonix itself is exclusively generating Tor activity on the network. To find out how easy/difficult it is for an ISP to detect Whonix see [[Fingerprint]] page for details.
}}

{{mbox
| type       = notice
| image      = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = If you download Whonix over Tor, using the [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Tor Browser Bundle], the fact that you are using Whonix will be hidden. This is because: {{TorifiedGateway}}
}}

{{mbox

| image      = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px|alt=Question mark]]
| text       = Hiding the fact that you are a Tor user is not so easy. More information below.
}}

Hiding the fact that you are a Tor user is very tricky to achieve. Be very careful. Here are some tips. This isn't a step by step tutorial. It's recommended to read the whole chapter.

Use either private and obfuscated bridges or a VPN/SSH proxy. On one hand, best chance to hide Tor might be to combine both ways, on the other hand, people who want to hide the fact that they are using Tor, may also have the same desire to hide the fact that they are using VPN or SSH.

Using private and obfuscated bridges alone doesn't provide strong guarantees of hiding your the fact you are using Tor from your ISP. Quote&lt;ref&gt;https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-April/002950.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcitation.org/6G67ltL45&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Appelbaum:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some pluggable transports may seek to obfuscate traffic or to morph it. However, they do not claim to hide that you are using Tor ''in all cases'' but rather in very specific cases. An example threat model includes a DPI device with limited time to make a classification choice - so the hiding is very specific to functionality and generally does not take into account endless data retention with retroactive policing.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Using a VPN or SSH does not provide strong guarantees of hiding your the fact you are using Tor from your ISP either. VPN's and SSH's are vulnerable to an attack called {{Code|website traffic fingerprinting}}&lt;ref&gt;For a reference for {{Code|website traffic fingerprinting}}, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN#VPNSSHFingerprinting VPN/SSH Fingerprinting] [http://www.webcitation.org/6Gmywywoj (w)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Warnings ==

* Think about, if your ISP knowing, you're a VPN or SSH user is acceptable to you.
* Download Tor through a trusted internet service provider (in your (home) country) or through SSH or VPN (or before entering a hostile environment).
* Setup the SSH/VPN tunnel or the private obfuscated bridges first. (Depending on what you want to use, read below.)
* If you are extra paranoid, you should also download VirtualBox over Tor.
* First, think about, how do you obtain the Tor Browser Bundle and obfuscated bridges and/or VPN and/or SSH, without your ISP noticing it? It's a chicken egg problem. You most likely have to get it from a trusted source. This isn't a problem, which Whonix could solve, it's a Tor upstream question.
* Another issue for hiding your Whonix usage is installing and/or downloading Whonix.
* Download.
** If you download Whonix from sf.net that download will go unencrypted and your internet service provider (or SSH/VPN provider) will learn that you downloaded Whonix.
*** A workaround could be, to download Whonix by using the official torproject.org Tor Browser Bundle.
*** Since Whonix 7 and above, you no longer have to turn off your network connection while starting Whonix for the first time, &lt;ref&gt;In previous versions (up to Whonix 0.5.6 turning off ones network connection while starting whonix for the first time was still required to prevent connecting to the public Tor network.&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to {{Code2|whonixsetup - Connection Wizard}}. Then set up everything to hide your Tor/Whonix usage, either by using a SSH or VPN or private obfuscated bridge, which is also covered on this page.
* Building from Source.
** You can learn everything about building Whonix, using the Tor Browser Bundle.
** If you are building Whonix from source, the build scripts, will download a specific set of software packages with of apt-get, Tor Browser with curl, update-command-not-found, and your internet service provider could notice that you are building Whonix from source.
** If you understand the build scripts, you can also manually build Whonix, by applying the commands and configuration files manually.
** See also [[Dev/Build Anonymity]].

== Using a Proxy ==

Impossible! (The connection between you and your proxy is unencrypted. That goes for all proxies, http, https, socks4, socks4a, socks5.) Your ISP could still see that you are connecting to the Tor network. This is only mentioned because that myth is constantly suggested and asked when this topic comes up.

== Using SSH or VPN ==

See warnings above first. By default all traffic of Whonix-Gateway is routed through Tor! You need to route all that traffc through SSH/VPN.

Tunnel all Tor related traffic first through a VPN or SSH. See [[Tunnel Tor through proxy or VPN or SSH]] (ignore the proxy related stuff). This will hide the fact that you use Tor from your ISP. If the server is outside a national firewall this is also a way to circumvent Tor censorship.

If you do not trust any SSH or VPN providers, then anonymously host your own in a safe place.

== Using private and obfuscated bridges ==

See warnings above first. Set up Tor to use private and obfuscated [[Bridges]]. This makes it harder for ISPs and national firewalls to detect and block Tor but it does not prevent a dedicated adversary to find out that you are using Tor (research is ongoing, see obfsproxy).

|description=Step by Step Instructions on how to set up VPNs in Conjunction with Whonix. Tor over VPN / VPN over Tor. VPN over Tor over VPN.
}}

= Introduction =

The purpose of this page is mainly to demonstrate, how easy it is, to add a VPN to Whonix, to tunnel user -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN or the other way around.

Read first [[Whonix:General_disclaimer#Whonix_VPN_disclaimer|Whonix VPN disclaimer]].

Can be either:

* [[Tunnel Tor through proxy or VPN or SSH|Tunnel Tor through VPN]]. (Read first!) (Install on Whonix-Gateway.)
* [[Tunnel Proxy or SSH or VPN through Tor|Tunnel VPN through Tor]]. (Read first!) (Install on Whonix-Workstation.)

Leave no personal information while signing up. Use an extra e-mail address for registration, which you will never use for anything else. If you plan to use user -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN, you should obviously also sign up using Tor. (Not sure, whats best, Tor or not, to sign up when planing on using user -&gt; VPN -&gt; Tor. Probably Tor can't hurt.)

= Examples =

== Riseup.net ==

=== Riseup.net Quick VPN Command Line Test ===
Known to support TCP, UDP, SSL.

(1) You need a riseup.net account.

(2) You need to know your riseup account name.

(3) Go to riseup.net -&gt; help -&gt; VPN and obtain your VPN secret. (VPN password)

(4) Look inside the [https://help.riseup.net/en/vpn-howto riseup VPN help page] for [https://help.riseup.net/en/riseup-ca &lt;code&gt;RiseupCA.pem&lt;/code&gt;] and download it.

(5) Open a terminal. (konsole) Get into the same folder, you stored &lt;code&gt;RiseupCA.pem&lt;/code&gt;.

(6) Install openvpn.

&lt;code&gt;
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install openvpn
&lt;/code&gt;

(7) The following line from the riseup OpenVPN help page&lt;ref&gt;https://help.riseup.net/en/openvpn-linux&lt;/ref&gt; won't work for user -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN, because the Tor network does not support UDP.

&lt;code&gt;
sudo openvpn --client --dev tun --auth-user-pass --remote vpn.riseup.net 1194 --ca RiseupCA.pem
&lt;/code&gt;

The following line works for user -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN.

&lt;code&gt;
sudo openvpn --client --dev tun --auth-user-pass --remote vpn.riseup.net 1194 --ca RiseupCA.pem --proto tcp
&lt;/code&gt;

(8) For DNS, see Riseup DNS below.

=== Riseup.net riseup.ovpn ===

Known to support TCP, UDP, SSL.

(1) You need a riseup.net account.

(2) You need to know your riseup account name.

(3) Go to riseup.net -&gt; help -&gt; VPN and obtain your VPN secret. (VPN password)

(4) Look inside the [https://help.riseup.net/en/vpn-howto riseup VPN help page] for [https://help.riseup.net/en/riseup-ca &lt;code&gt;RiseupCA.pem&lt;/code&gt;] and download it.

(5) Create a file auth.txt inside the same folder.

&lt;pre&gt;
riseupusername
vpnsecret
&lt;/pre&gt;

(6) Create a file riseup.ovpn inside the same folder.

&lt;pre&gt;
client
dev tun
auth-user-pass auth.txt
#remote vpn.riseup.net 443
#remote seattle.vpn.riseup.net 443
remote nyc.vpn.riseup.net 80
ca RiseupCA.pem
remote-cert-tls server
script-security 1
#user nobody
#group nobody
proto tcp
&lt;/pre&gt;

(7) Start OpenVPN.

&lt;code&gt;
sudo openvpn riseup.ovpn
&lt;/code&gt;

(8) For DNS, see Riseup DNS below.

=== Riseup DNS ===

==== Setup ====

Open ''/etc/resolv.conf''.

&lt;pre&gt;
kdesudo kwrite /etc/resolv.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

Comment out.

&lt;pre&gt;
#nameserver 192.168.0.10
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Riseup.net OpenVPN DNS server
nameserver 172.27.100.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to be sure, that ''/etc/resolv.conf'' does not get overwritten by other packages. (Such as DHCP or resolvconf.)

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you ever want to remove it, use ''-i''.

==== Testing ====

When using &quot;''nameserver 192.168.0.10''&quot;...

&lt;pre&gt;nslookup idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion&lt;/pre&gt;

Will show.

&lt;pre&gt;
Server:         192.168.0.10
Address:        192.168.0.10#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion
Address: 10.192.0.1&lt;/pre&gt;

When using &quot;''nameserver 172.27.100.1''&quot;...

&lt;pre&gt;nslookup idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion&lt;/pre&gt;

Will show.

&lt;pre&gt;
Server:         172.27.100.1
Address:        172.27.100.1#53

** server can't find idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion: NXDOMAIN
&lt;/pre&gt;

Because you can not access .onion domains when a VPN has be chained. (user -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN)

Resolving clearnet DNS should work.

&lt;pre&gt;nslookup riseup.net&lt;/pre&gt;

Should show.

&lt;pre&gt;
Server:         172.27.100.1
Address:        172.27.100.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   riseup.net
Address: 198.252.153.35
&lt;/pre&gt;

== securityKISS.com ==

Unfortunately securityKISS.com drops many TCP and UDP ports besides ports 80 and 443. That limits its usefulness for testing purposes, such as [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]]. If you know a less restrictive free VPN provider, we'd be thankful for a comment.

Install openvpn.

&lt;pre&gt;apt-get install openvpn&lt;/pre&gt;

Register at securitykiss.com, login and download their OpenVPN package to /home/user. Unpack. The folder contains contains ca.cert, client.cert, client.key, README.txt (with list of their servers and ports). Rename the folder to securitykiss. Structure should be like /home/user/ca.cert etc.

''nano /etc/openvpn/client.conf'', edit server IP and port and past it. (It's almost only the default openvpn client.conf with minor changes.)

To initially start the VPN type:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/openvpn start
sudo openvpn /etc/openvpn/client.conf&lt;/pre&gt;

After rebooting the VPN will be automatically started.

If you do not wish to start the VPN automatically for some reason: ''nano /etc/default/openvpn''

&lt;pre&gt;AUTOSTART==&quot;none&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

DNS settings have not been considered for this securitykiss.com chapter.

== usaip.eu ==

For testing purposes, in past, [https://www.usaip.eu/ usaip.eu] was used. They have been chosen, because they were free and didn't block the tested outgoing UDP port. The free version of usaip.eu can probably only be used for testing purposes, as it's only a test version, which force disconnects every 7 minutes. For longer and serious/stable use, you'll probably need another, VPN account.

'''Note, usaip probably blocks SSL, therefore'''

&lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/curl --tlsv1 --proto =https https://check.torproject.org&lt;/code&gt;

'''will not work.'''

Install OpenVPN.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install openvpn&lt;/pre&gt;

Go to [http://usaip.eu/en/index.php usaip.eu] and click on free demo. Download the ''usaip.zip''. It contains the OpenVPN configuration files. Unpack. Open a shell and get into the folder ''cd usaip''. List all files ''dir''. Connect to a VPN, for example:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo openvpn /home/user/usaip/eu-luxemburg.ovpn&lt;/pre&gt;

At time of writing, the page stated, the password was ''demo'', password also ''demo''. Wait until it's connected. When success, it will show &quot;Initialization Sequence Completed&quot;. It might happen, that the connection will not succeed for some unknown reason. In this case try replacing the eu-luxemburg.ovpn from the example above with another &lt;country&gt;.ovpn from the usaip folder.

DNS settings have not been considered for this usaip.eu chapter.

== Using a graphical user interface ==

=== KDE Network Manager ===

If you want to install the KDE Network Manager.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install network-manager-kde&lt;/pre&gt;
Start menu -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Network Settings

At time of writing the [https://www.riseup.net/en/openvpn-linux#kde riseup.net OpenVPN instructions for KDE] where not finished. Perhaps you'll find out yourself, use another guide for KDE Network Manager or use the command line based examples above.

Don't wonder if you don't see Whonix-Workstation's (virtual) wired network interface to Whonix-Gateway. That's still managed by the ordinary ifupdown way in /etc/network/interfaces. See [[Dev/Network Manager]] if you want to know why it's not installed by default in Whonix.

=== GNOME Network Manager ===

Although Whonix is by default based on KDE, you can usually integrate GNOME applications.

In case of GNOME Network Manager it just requires some more fiddling because upstream developers wanted to make GNOME and KDE as compatible as possible, which includes that one settings manager won't show up when the other desktop has been started in a dual (KDE, GNOME) installation.

If you want to install the GNOME Network Manager.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome network-manager-openvpn-gnome&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to autostart GNOME Network Manager, open /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop with root rights.

&lt;pre&gt;kdesudo kwrite /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop&lt;/pre&gt;

And comment out.

&lt;pre&gt;NotShowIn=KDE;&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to make the nm-applet start menu entries visible and to start it manually, open /usr/share/applications/nm-applet.desktop.

&lt;pre&gt;kdesudo kwrite /usr/share/applications/nm-applet.desktop&lt;/pre&gt;

And comment out.

&lt;pre&gt;NotShowIn=KDE;&lt;/pre&gt;

And add.

&lt;pre&gt;Categories=GNOME;GTK;Settings;X-GNOME-NetworkSettings;&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to make the nm-connection-editor start menu entries visible and to start it manually, open nm-connection-editor.

&lt;pre&gt;kdesudo kwrite /usr/share/applications/nm-connection-editor.desktop&lt;/pre&gt;

And comment out.

&lt;pre&gt;NotShowIn=KDE;&lt;/pre&gt;

Then you could open the settings.

&lt;pre&gt;Applications -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network Connections &lt;/pre&gt;

You could try the [https://www.riseup.net/en/openvpn-linux#gnome riseup.net OpenVPN instructions for GNOME].

|description=Security by Isolation. Using Whonix with Physical Isolation on Bare Metal for Better Security.
}}

'''WARNING''': Please don't forget reading the Warnings chapter.

= Introduction =
== Technical Introduction ==
When setting up Whonix in the form of two Virtual Machines running on the same physical host, exploits targeting the VM implementation or the host can still break out of the torified Client VM and expose the IP of a user. Malware running on the host has full control over all VMs. To protect such attacks we need a different approach: In this context we called it Physical Isolation, because the gateway system is installed on separate hardware. This drastically reduces the TCB&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base&lt;/ref&gt; by more than the half.

In total we'll be installing and configuring two computers and set up an isolated point to point network between them (you could also set up a an ordinary, completely isolated, LAN behind the Whonix-Gateway). One computer acts as the client or &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot;, the other as a proxy or &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; which will transparently route all of the Whonix-Workstation's traffic through Tor.

The Whonix-Gateway on its own physical device can either run directly on hardware or inside a virtual machine. Both options have advantages and disadvantages. We recommend to use no additional Virtual Machine for the Whonix-Gateway.

The Whonix-Workstation should always be installed in a Virtual Machine: A VM hides hardware serial numbers. See also [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots|Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots]].

The host operating system(s) should only be used for downloading operating system updating, hosting Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation and nothing else.

Bonus points if the physical systems are exclusively used for hosting Whonix, or if storage devices are separated for Whonix and non-Whonix use cases, to avoid a Whonix hard drive getting infected by a another operating system.

== Warnings ==
'''WARNING''': Less tested than VM builds. Needs your help for more rigid testing!

'''WARNING''': Instructions are difficult. Only advanced Linux users can understand them.

'''WARNING''': [[Dev/Build Anonymity]] has not been considered for this article.

'''WARNING''': Do also read the [[Dev/BuildDocumentation_8#Warning|warnings]] in the [[Dev/BuildDocumentation|latest build instructions for VM images]]. Some of them, {{Code2|Don't add private files to Whonix's source code folder!}} and {{Code2|Check if the OpenPGP public keys are still up to date.}} also applies to the physical isolation page.

'''WARNING''': This article currently lacks information about Whonix-Gateway's and Whonix-Workstation's MAC address. See also

* [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]]
* [[Pre_Install_Advice#MAC_Address|Whonix in public networks / MAC Address]]

== Using spare hardware + Virtual Machine ==

Advantages:

* You can install a graphical host.
* Use the Whonix download version.
* You can use the graphical network manager on the host, for example to connect to WiFi.
* You can setup easily a VPN on the host. Tor will be tunneled through the VPN.

Disadvantages:

* Higher attack surface, because the Virtual Machine code get's involved.

== Using spare hardware without Virtual Machine ==

Advantages:

* More secure, because less code is involved.

Disadvantages:

* Slightly more complicated setup
* More difficult to set up VPN
* More difficult to set up 3G networking compared to using a Windows host

== Hardware ==

=== General ===

We recommend that you use two dedicated computers for Whonix that are never used for activities that could lead back to your identity. Alternatively you can use an already existing and otherwise used computer for the Whonix-Gateway. To offer some isolation you should disconnect all internal and external drives and boot from a eSATA, USB or another internal drive into a clean environment.

=== non-anonymous use ===

* non-anonymous box (leave it as it is, like you want)
* non-anonymous home dial up internet router (leave it as it is, like you want)

=== anonymous use ===

* Whonix-Gateway
** This really does not have to be a big desktop computer or ordinary server. There are alternatives.
** smartphone &lt;ref name=one&gt;Just some hints to get started. It is difficult and beyond the scope of Whonix, because you don't have an Ethernet interface. Some (after market) firmwares support USB-host. (You can plug USB devices into your phone, such as an USB ethernet card. For example some rooted android smartphones can [http://android.galoula.com/en/LinuxInstall/ install] Debian Linux.&lt;/ref&gt;,

* Whonix-Workstation
** You get the idea. Use a device which suits you.

= Prerequisites =
* [[System Requirements]]
* Whonix-Gateway: A device with at least two network adapters, at least one of them ethernet &lt;ref&gt;The other one may be either an [[Security_Guide#Anonymous_3G_modem|Anonymous 3G modem]]; [[Security_Guide#Anonymous_WiFi_adapter|Anonymous WiFi adapter]], another ethernet or wifi connected to your modem/router.&lt;/ref&gt;, capable of running Linux. It will run Debian. &lt;ref&gt;Theoretically you could use any OS that supports iptables or pf. If you don't want to use Debian you will have to edit the source code. This will be easy for Debian derivatives but much more difficult for *BSD for example. In any case, the choice of OS shouldn't really matter because this system isn't used for anything but running Tor. A cheap plug computer, something like Raspberry Pi or the hardware used by Torouter would be sufficient.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whonix-Workstation: A device connected via ethernet to the Whonix-Gateway. It must only have this one NIC and no other network connectivity! Must be connected by wire.&lt;ref&gt;If you don't connect by wire, you significantly weaken isolation and security. One the Whonix-Workstation were infected, it could jump onto another network and start leaking.&lt;/ref&gt; This will be the torified client system or Whonix-Workstation. It must be capable of running Debian.&lt;ref&gt;Any OS can be used. But this is not recommended! If you do anyway, read warning, especially for Windows: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks].&lt;/ref&gt;
* We recommend to use a VM as the client, the same Whonix-Workstation, that most non Physical Isolation users use. &lt;ref&gt;From the [[Download]] page or build it yourself from source code.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;A generic VM image can neither leak identifying hardware serial numbers nor unique software fingerprints. (e.g. trough [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Softwareupdaters software updates]).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;This ensures that you get the latest security features and most secure configurations. (Such as stream isolation that protects against Identity correlation through circuit sharing, XChat IRC hardening or Whonix's Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection etc.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Host build environment has a working internet connection to Debian mirrors.
* General advice from Build Documentation about [[Dev/BuildDocumentation_8#Build_Security|Build Security]] applies
* Optionally, it would be useful, if you knew how to open a second [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]].

= Host Preparation =
&lt;!--
EDITORS NOTE: The following host preparation text is duplicated on 3 pages.
(1) [[Physical Isolation]]
(2) [[Dev/Build Documentation]] for VM images
(3) Whonix debian packages.
When making changes here, please consider also making changes there.
--&gt;
* You need to build on '''Debian Stable (Wheezy)'''. (How to obtain Debian safely: &lt;ref&gt;[[Debian|Debian ISO OpenPGP verification]]&lt;/ref&gt;) &lt;ref&gt;The build scripts could be adapted to run on other {{Code2|*NIX}} systems as well but currently they assume {{Code2|apt-get}} and {{Code2|grml-debootstrap}} to be available. You need about 15 GB of free space.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Build dependencies and configurations get automatically applied, so you don't have to worry about that. &lt;ref&gt;By {{Code2|[https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine]}}.))&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is recommended to set your terminal (for example Konsole) to unlimited scrollback, so you can watch the full build log.

= How To Install Whonix-Gateway on Hardware (RECOMMENDED) =
== Get Debian ==
Download a Debian Stable/Wheezy 32 bit installation iso. Detailed instructions doing so are unfortunately not part of this guide. However, the [[Debian]] page contains some help.

You can choose iso of any desktop environment (KDE, LXDE, Xfce, ...) but since you'll be using the command line, Debian Stable/Wheezy network install (netinst) version is recommended (it's the most minimal).

(You could also use a Debian Stable/Wheezy 64 bit installation iso, these instructions should also work, but it's less tested.)

&lt;/div&gt;

== Network Configuration ==
The external interface (usually eth0) may need to be configured according to the requirements of your local network, e.g. static or simply left to use dhcp if the gateway is connected to a dhcp capable router. For wlan follow the upstream documentations: [http://wiki.debian.org/WiFi debian wiki], [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WiFiHowTo Ubuntu help].

Make sure the internet is working.

== Logon and upgrade Debian ==
Logon, install all security updates and reboot.

&lt;pre&gt;
## (host) login with &quot;root&quot;
root

## Add a new repository source.
echo &quot;deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian stable main&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list

## Refresh package lists and upgrade
apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade -y
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Preparation ==
Install sudo and git. &lt;ref&gt;You need git to obtain the source code. Alternatively, you could also download a git tag as an archive using a (torified) browser: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tags&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
## Install &quot;sudo&quot; and git.
apt-get install sudo git -y
&lt;/pre&gt;

You must build as user &quot;user&quot; and that user must be a member of the &quot;sudo&quot; group. Rebooting applies the changes.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Add &quot;user&quot; to &quot;sudo&quot; group
addgroup user sudo

## Reboot the system
shutdown -r now

## (host) login with &quot;user&quot;
user
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Optional''': &lt;br /&gt;
You may want to take an image of your installation in case the build script fails in the middle.

{{Build Documentation Get Source Code}}

{{Build Configuration}}

== Install Basic Packages ==
This step is only required up to and including Whonix 8. Versions higher than Whonix 8 do not require this manual step anymore.

Make sure you have all packages installed which are listed in the file {{Code2|grml_packages}}. You can do that using the following command.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install $(grep -vE &quot;^\s*#&quot; grml_packages | tr &quot;\n&quot; &quot; &quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Network Verification ==
Before running the {{Code2|whonix_build}} script make sure eth1 and eth0 refer to the correct interfaces.

&lt;pre&gt;
## May be helpful.
dmesg | grep eth
&lt;/pre&gt;

Otherwise you have to change the variables in the configuration files. To find the affected files, the following commands may be helpful. &lt;ref&gt;Should be really only a very few files. We used variables for eth0 and eth1 wherever possible.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
grep -r eth0 *
grep -r eth1 *
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Minor Things ==
&lt;s&gt;Most configuration files work well inside Virtual Machines and on hardware. Only minor things such as deactivating powersaving, passwordless reboot, shutdown etc. are only recommended for Virtual Machines. You can easily comment them out by putting a hash # in front of them. They are marked, to find them, grep can be used.&lt;/s&gt; Skip this for now. You can change these files later after building Whonix. (Simpler.)

&lt;pre&gt;
grep -r VMONLY* *
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Run Build Script ==
It is recommended that you create a log of the build process by redirecting all the output to a log file. Be aware that by doing so no build progress will appear on the screen - instead a text log file will be created in your home folder. 

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --tor-gateway --bare-metal --build &gt;&gt; ~/log-bare-metal 2&gt;&amp;1
&lt;/pre&gt;

To optionally watch the progress, open a second [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]] and type.

&lt;pre&gt;
tail -f ~/log-bare-metal
&lt;/pre&gt;

If don't want to create a log of the build process (the build progress will then appear on screen) use the following command. 

'''This is not recommended because if anything goes wrong during the build, it will be harder to pinpoint the exact error without the actual log file.'''

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --tor-gateway --bare-metal --build
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Final Steps ==
Reboot.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo reboot
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will autologin as new user &quot;user&quot;. (If you didn't install as user &quot;user&quot;, your old user and home folder does of course still exist.)

The build script will have replaced your {{Code|/etc/network/interfaces}} with the respective file from {{Code|whonix_gateway/etc/network/interfaces}}. Your original network configuration file can still be found under {{Code|/etc/network/interfaces.whonix-orig}}. Should you require specific changes (those you might have required to add in the network configuration step above, such as eventually setting up WiFi), you need to make them again in {{Code|/etc/network/interfaces}}. Restart your network again ({{Code|sudo service networking restart}}) or reboot.

Done.

== Cleanup ==
{{Build Documentation Cleanup}}

= How To Install Whonix-Gateway in a VM (UNTESTED / NOT RECOMMENDED) =

It is advised to install a new OS just for hosting the Gateway VM, any OS that can run VirtualBox works but we recommend an Open Source system.

[[Download]] the Whonix-Gateway image. (Or [[Dev/Build Documentation|build it]] from source code.)

Adapter 1 can be set up as a NAT network. Adapter 2 must either be set to NAT as well (but you will need to forward ports from the host to the guest) or much simpler: use bridged networking and set it to the second physical interface (the one that goes into the isolated network/point to point ethernet). See &quot;NAT vs Bridging&quot; below.

This configuration is entirely untested and not recommended unless you need to run Tor through a VPN (can't that be done without VMs?) or an unsupported 3G modem and can't afford a 3rd physical device.

When using NAT for a virtualized Gateway you need to set up port forwarding in VirtualBox. Using bridged network may be easier, but then the router may see the Whonix-Gateway MAC address which identifies as Whonix-Gateway. (Should not be of concern in home networks. Should be of concern in untrusted networks or when using a modem to connect.)

= Install Whonix-Workstation in a VM (RECOMMENDED) =

=== First Steps ===

Install and update a host operating system. On the host can run any OS that is capable of running VirtualBox, but be aware of [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks]. It is recommended against to use Windows or another other commercial proprietary system as host operating system.

[[Download]] the Whonix-Workstation image. (Or [[Dev/Build Documentation|build it]] from source code.)

Note sure what we wanted to say with this sentence: If the physical network (between Whonix-Gateway and a router) uses 192.168.0.* you need to review and edit all shell scripts and switch the internal network to something else!

=== Host Network Adapter ===

The host has to be configured to use the static IP configuration.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Whonix-Workstation
## /etc/network/interfaces for the host,
## when using Physical Isolation,
## with Whonix-Workstation in a VM.

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
   ## Increment last octet of address
   ## on optional additional hosts.
   address 192.168.0.11
   netmask 255.255.255.0
   gateway 192.168.0.10
   #pre-up /usr/bin/whonix_firewall

   ## Out commented.
   ## For what do we require the network and broadcast
   ## instances anyway?
   #network 192.168.0.0
   #broadcast 192.168.0.255

#auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp

## end of /etc/network/interfaces
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the physical network (between Whonix-Gateway and a router) uses 192.168.0.* you need to review and edit all ''/etc/network/interfaces''.

=== NAT vs Bridging ===

==== Two Choices ====

In the default Whonix VirtualBox image, the network adapter setting for Adapter 1 (eth0) is set to internal network and will therefore not work out of the box. There are two choices to fix this. NAT (recommended) or bridged network.

==== NAT (RECOMMENDED) ====

If you use NAT you will have to edit the ''/etc/network/interfaces/'' in Whonix-Workstation to use DHCP (easier, shown in the example below) or a static IP for VirtualBox NAT.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces/
&lt;/pre&gt;

Replace it with.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Whonix-Workstation
## /etc/network/interfaces in a VM
## when using Physical Isolation.

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

## end of /etc/network/interfaces
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Bridged Network (UNTESTED / NOT RECOMMENDED) ====

If you use bridged networking things will (or should, we haven't tested anything yet) just work.

Since in the bridged network case, Whonix-Workstation can see the MAC address of whatever network adapter it is connected to, you should change the MAC address of the Workstation host and of the Whonix-Gateway.

See [[Pre_Install_Advice#MAC_Address|Whonix in public networks]].

= Install Whonix-Workstation on hardware (NOT RECOMMENDED) =

Install Whonix-Workstation on hardware without using a VM is recommended against, because hardware serials would be visible to Whonix-Workstation.

The instructions are very similar, if not the very same, to those in &quot;How To Install Whonix-Gateway on hardware&quot; above. You have to use {{Code2|--tor-workstation}} instead of {{Code2|--tor-gateway}}.

= Further required reading =

[[Documentation]]. The host security chapter applies to both computers!

= Extra packages for better hardware support =

Some packages for bare metal may or may not be missing. Here is a probably incomplete list of packages, which may or may not be useful for better hardware support. Some suggestions.

&lt;pre&gt;
xorg
xserver-xorg-input-all
xserver-xorg-input-wacom
xserver-xorg-input-geode
xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse
xserver-xephyr

xserver-xorg-input-*
xserver-xorg-*

acpi-support-base
acpid
acpi

discover
discover-modprobe
discover-data

hwdata

mdetect

apt-cache show task-desktop
apt-cache show task-kde-desktop
apt-cache show task-laptop
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you have EFI bios.

&lt;pre&gt;
grub-efi-amd64
&lt;/pre&gt;

To get a more complete list, install Debian (with KDE) on bare metal using the regular Debian installer medium.

* diff &quot;dpkg -l&quot; with Whonix
* diff &quot;sudo lsmod&quot; with Whonix

|description=About Whonix's Network, Bridge/Guard and ISP Fingerprint.
}}
= Fingerprint =

In this context we use the term ''fingerprint'' to refer to the specificities in the way Whonix behaves on Internet. Those specificities could be used to determine whether a particular user is using Whonix or not.

As explained on our [[Warning]] page, when using Whonix it is possible to know that you are using Tor. But Whonix tries to make it as difficult as possible to distinguish Whonix users from other Tor users, especially Tor Browser Bundle (TBB&lt;ref name=&quot;tbb&quot; /&gt;) users. If it is possible to determine whether your are a Whonix user or a TBB&lt;ref name=tbb&gt;TBB stands for [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Tor Browser Bundle]. It's included in Whonix, see [[Tor Browser]].&lt;/ref&gt; user, this provides more information about you and in consequence reduces your anonymity.

This section explains some issues regarding the fingerprint of Whonix and how this could be used to identify you as a Whonix user.

= For the websites that you are visiting =

The websites that you are visiting can retrieve a lot of information about your browser. That information can include its name and version, window size, list of available extensions, timezone, available fonts, etc.

To make it difficult to distinguish Whonix users from TBB&lt;ref name=&quot;tbb&quot; /&gt; users, Whonix includes TBB&lt;ref name=&quot;tbb&quot; /&gt; and therefore should provide the same information as the TBB&lt;ref name=&quot;tbb&quot; /&gt; in order to have similar fingerprints.

= For your ISP or local network administrator =

This is difficult (impossible?) to say with 100% certainty, since part of this is still a general Tor (not Whonix!) research question. It's also impossible to prove a negative.

Whonix is itself exclusively generating Tor activity on the network. Both, all traffic from Whonix-Workstation (TBB&lt;ref name=&quot;tbb&quot; /&gt;, updates, timesync, etc.) and Whonix-Gateway (updates, timesync) goes through Tor. Getting online activity is the task of the host, so the host &lt;ref&gt;In case of Default/Download version, it's the host's task to get online. In case of [[PhysicalIsolation]] it's the Gateway's task to get online. &lt;/ref&gt; is most likely using DHCP to obtain a local IP address. Usually TBB&lt;ref name=&quot;tbb&quot; /&gt; users also have network activity outside of Tor, either from another web browser or other applications. So the proportion or amount of Tor activity could be used to determine whether a user is using Whonix or the TBB&lt;ref name=&quot;tbb&quot; /&gt;. If you are sharing your Internet connection with other users that are not using Whonix or if you also use a browser on the host &lt;ref&gt;Which would come with the risk of the user confusing one browser for another.&lt;/ref&gt;, it is probably harder for your ISP to determine whether a single user is generating only Tor traffic and so maybe using Whonix.

Whonix uses the &lt;code&gt;entry guards mechanism&lt;/code&gt; of Tor. With the &lt;code&gt;entry guard mechanism&lt;/code&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards&lt;/ref&gt;, a Tor user always uses the same few relays as first hops, which is a security feature. &lt;code&gt;Whonix uses an unmodified version of Tor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[FAQ#Does_Whonix_modify_Tor.3F | Whonix uses an unmodified version of Tor]]&lt;/ref&gt;, but a &lt;code&gt;configured torrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/tor/torrc.whonix&lt;/ref&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;Stream Isolation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stream Isolation]]&lt;/ref&gt; security feature.

When starting, Whonix synchronizes the system clock to make sure it differs from the host clock and is not too much off (&lt;code&gt;TimeSync&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TimeSync]]&lt;/ref&gt;). &lt;code&gt;whonixcheck&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[whonixcheck]]&lt;/ref&gt; issues some network traffic to check for updates and news, all goes through different circuits, which might be specific to Whonix. (Unchecked theory, it is unknown if an ISP can guess &quot;oh, this Tor user opens many different Tor circuits.&quot; On the other hand, Tor seems to open only X entry guards and keep them for a while, thus not opening as many entry guards as streams.)

There is also the general Tor research question &lt;code&gt;Website traffic fingerprinting&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ Tor Browser Design] for Website traffic fingerprinting.&lt;/ref&gt;. (Not a Whonix specific issue!) No one ever researched yet, if that also applies to &lt;code&gt;other traffic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Such as apt-get traffic.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In conclusion, if your ISP or local network administrator can determine someone is using the official Tor Browser Bundle from The Tor Project, Whonix, a custom transparent Tor proxy or similar project, depends on how well Tor actually works. Since Whonix is itself exclusively generating Tor activity on the network and relies on Tor to obfuscate that traffic, it really depends on Tor and these are open research questions.

|description=Staying anonymous while building Whonix from source code.
}}
{{forkme}}
= Build Anonymity =
This does only apply, if you are going to build Whonix from source, and/or if you are going to redistribute Whonix and/or if you are going to use Physical Isolation. This is not a Whonix specific problem. Most projects do not even have a chapter about build anonymity. While building Whonix, software has to be downloaded. It's a unique selection of software and there is no way to make it non-unique. Therefore your '''i'''nternet '''s'''ervice '''p'''rovider (ISP) could guess, that you are building Whonix. This should not be of any concern in a free country (free by your own definition), if the content of your traffic is not being observed or logged.

Especially, but not exclusively, in case you want to redistribute Whonix, you might be interested to hide the fact, you are building Whonix (i.e. you want to stay anonymous).

To prevent any kind of personally identifiable or even fingerprintable information leaking from the build system into the Whonix images, it is recommended to build inside of an already torified Virtual Machine. &lt;ref&gt;Yes, this creates a bootstrap, chicken or egg problem. To solve it you can either download already existing Whonix binary builds or if you prefer to build from source, build a minimal torified machine yourself first while running any network traffic over Tor. Any help required with that? [[Contact]] us. See also [[Manually Creating Whonix]].&lt;/ref&gt; You can build Whonix inside an existing Whonix-Workstation, but it can also be built on a headless server.

It's also recommended to build in an already torified Virtual Machine, because that prevents leaks from the build system, which could help an attacker (with root access to the Whonix-Workstation), to gather identifiable information about that build system, that could ultimately lead back to your identity.

Beginning with Whonix 0.4.0, we use grml-debootstrap and chroot for virtual machine image creation. The grml-debootstrap source code tells, that it copies /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf into the chroot. grml-debootstrap also mounts a lot devices (/dev, /proc etc.) inside the chroot and later Whonix's chroot also mounts some devices. That's why it's recommended to build inside an already torified virtual machine.

Building from source code naturally also leaves local traces on the disk, such as the source code itself and build dependencies. If that is of concern to you, it can be more easily disposed, when it's contained in a Virtual Machine.

It would also be possible to build directly on the host and torify all connections the scripts make, but we don't know what other grml-debootstrap/chroot related leaks there might be.

We know it's not the best solution to build inside a VM.

== VirtualBox inside VirtualBox ==
VirtualBox inside VirtualBox is no longer required since 0.4.4. If you want to use it anyway, for example for testing the Virtual Machines inside VirtualBox, here are some suggestions.

Using {{Code|vboxmanage &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot; modifyvm --acpi on}} and {{Code|vboxmanage &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot; modifyvm --ioapic on}} for all VM's, i.e. for the build_Whonix-Workstation and the ones you build, speeds up the VM inside the VM a lot. That is already the default for Whonix Virtual Machines since version 0.2.0.

If you are going to use VirtualBox inside VirtualBox, be sure to change your host key. VirtualBox -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Input -&gt; Host Key. The &quot;outside&quot; and the &quot;inside&quot; Host Key must differ, otherwise you can not leave the VM &quot;inside&quot; anymore.

|description=Anonymous E-Mail. Thunderbird. Icedove. Remailer. Encryption. Mixmaster. Nym.
}}
[[Image:Thunderbird_17.0.png|400px|thumb|Mozilla Thunderbird (called Icedove in Debian) with TorBirdy]]
= Introduction =

You can either use [[#Webmail|Webmail]] through [[Tor Browser]] or [[#Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy|Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy]].

None of the solutions is perfect. This is not a Whonix related issue. It is a general issue with e-mail over Tor.

= Threats =

It is often recommended to use mail encryption (enigmail). Yes, that's good. Use it. Remember, as stated on the [[Warning]] page, subjects are always unencrypted. That's not everything however.

Registering the e-mail address anonymously, i.e. not entering personal data and only accessing it over Tor is a sure thing.

If you have a website or other kind of project, you must publish your e-mail address so others can write.

The e-mail provider is always a single point of failure. If the provider gets pressured, forced or decides not to like your opinion anymore or feels like terminating the service for everyone, the e-mail account can be easily terminated in seconds. This can significantly slow down correspondence. Therefore it's always good to have a few backup e-mail address and alternative communication channels.

Even if subjects are random, hidden, -, empty or misleading and the content is encrypted, the e-mail provider can still log valuable data. When you logged in, how long, how often you fetch mail, how fast you type &lt;ref name=javascript&gt;Only with javascript-enabled webmail.&lt;/ref&gt;, how long you read a message &lt;ref name=javascript /&gt;, which spelling mistakes you make and correct &lt;ref name=javascript /&gt;, to which address mails are sent, when you receive mails, from which addresses and when. That's quite a lot metadata, which may lead into (false) assumptions by an adversary.

= Encryption =

E-mail encryption is recommended. Mastering e-mail encryption isn't hard, but involves a learning curve. It's outside the scope of this guide, see external documentation.

= Webmail =

Many webmail services require JavaScript, display web bugs and you must be careful when receiving attachments.

'''TODO''': Expand.

= Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy =
[[Image:Thunderbird_17.0.png|400px|thumb|Mozilla Thunderbird (called Icedove in Debian) with TorBirdy]]

Mozilla Thunderbird (called Icedove in Debian) together with the TorBirdy&lt;ref&gt;[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy TorBirdy Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/downloads/ioerror/torbirdy TorBirdy Source Code]&lt;/ref&gt; add-on can be used as an anonymous (or pseudonymous) e-mail client. TorBirdy is an equivalent of TorButton

Follow these steps on your Whonix-Workstation.

1. Install Mozilla Thunderbird (Icedove).

&lt;pre&gt;
# For special setups, Ubuntu etc.
#sudo apt-get install thunderbird

# Whonix default: in Debian.
sudo apt-get install icedove
&lt;/pre&gt;

2. If you like, you can also optionally install enigmail&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; (A simple interface for OpenPGP email encryption.).

&lt;s&gt;sudo apt-get install enigmail&lt;/s&gt;

It is currently not in Debian. You can download it here: &lt;br /&gt;
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/

Note, TorBirdy issue: as per &lt;code&gt;Enigmail (OpenPGP for Thunderbird/Icedove)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy#EnigmailOpenPGPGPGforThunderbird&lt;/ref&gt; Enigmail traffic with TorBirdy currently fails.

Whonix users can use gpg command line to get or to push keys from/to keyservers, because gnupg in Whonix is already configured safely.

3. Go to Tools -&gt; Addons -&gt; Extensions -&gt; deactivate all.

4. Go to Tools -&gt; Addons -&gt; Addons -&gt; deactivate all.

5. Download the most recent .xpi of [https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbirdy/ TorBirdy] from torproject.org. At time of writing there was a link to the latest version, you have to right click -&gt; Save Link as, to download the following link, [https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbirdy/torbirdy-current.xpi torbirdy-current.xpi].

6. Also download the corresponding signature. At time of writing there was a link to the latest corresponding signature, you have to right click -&gt; Save Link as, to download the following link, [https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbirdy/torbirdy-current.xpi.asc torbirdy-current.xpi.asc].

7. Get Jacob Appelbaum's OpenPGP key.&lt;ref&gt;Bug: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6382&lt;/ref&gt;

8. OpenPGP verify.

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --verify torbirdy-current.xpi.asc torbirdy-current.xpi
&lt;/pre&gt;

Must be &quot;Good Signature&quot;.

9. Go to Thunderbird/Icedove -&gt; Tools -&gt; Addons -&gt; Install Addon from file (button in the upper right) -&gt; choose torbirdy.xpi.

10. There are no proxy settings required &lt;ref&gt;For [[Stream Isolation]].&lt;/ref&gt;, because since TorBirdy 0.1.0, TorBirdy natively supports Whonix.&lt;ref&gt;TorBirdy sets Socks Host to 192.168.0.10 and Port to 9102, if the WHONIX variable is set, which is the default in /etc/environment since Whonix 0.5.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

11. If you are using enigmail for OpenPGP encryption, it's recommended to check &quot;Always confirm before sending&quot; checked in Enigmail -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Sending.

See [[Remailer]].

= E-Mail Provider Comparison =

== Introduction ==

Patrick Schleizer has been asked whether i2pmail is safer than tormail, riseup, gmail and so on. The ''Threats'' chapter above states &quot;''e-mail is always a single point of failure''&quot;. It doesn't really matter, apart from privacy by policy, no e-mail provider can significantly improve privacy by design. The most important thing about e-mail providers you should ask about e-mail providers is: Will they tolerate me signing up by Tor and exclusively using the e-mail service over Tor? Will they suspend my e-mail account because I speak against someone and they get forced to suspend my account? The latter question applies more, if you run a project, movement or something like that and less for accounts, which barely anyone knows.

Other than privacy by design, privacy by policy is always a weak protection. An exception might be services, which are not classical e-mail and therefore incompatible, but e-mail alike services such as Usenet (see below), I2P-Bote (see below), RetroShare or TorChat (See [[Chat]]).

A few frequently discussed mail providers are described above with some facts. There is no recommendation for or against any mail providers.

== tormail.org ==
&lt;s&gt;
* Not affiliated with The Tor Project.
* Rumors about being hosted by a secret service. It doesn't really matter, you shouldn't trust mail providers anyway. Assume, anything they can log, they will log forever.
* They technically can not even store Tor exit IP addresses (perhaps mail clients without TorBirdy, put aside) because it's a hidden service.
* Does not work reliable for mailing lists. After a while the user gets unsubscribed because tormail bounces too many mails.
* I haven't heard about any e-mail accounts which got suspended. (Well, I don't know about spam abuse, but that's another story.)
* They are obviously Tor-friendly.
* Things said in the ''Threats'' chapter still apply.
&lt;/s&gt;

The Tor Mail service is now offline&lt;ref&gt;https://openwatch.net/i/200/anonymous-web-host-freedom-hosting-owner-arrested&lt;/ref&gt;, as it was hosted on Freedom Hosting and was taken down by the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/09/freedom-hosting-fbi/&lt;/ref&gt;

== i2pmail.org ==

* Quoted from wikipedia I2P&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P&lt;/ref&gt;: &quot;''I2P has a free pseudonymous e-mail service run by an individual called Postman. Susimail is a web-based e-mail client intended primarily for use with Postman's mail servers, and is designed with security and anonymity in mind. Susimail was created to address privacy concerns in using these servers directly using traditional email clients, such as leaking the user's hostname while communicating with the SMTP server. It is currently included in the default I2P distribution, and can be accessed through the I2P router console web interface. Mail.i2p can contact both i2p email users, via user@mail.i2p and public internet email users from a user@i2pmail.org address.''&quot;
* Cleaning the mail header is nice, but TorBirdy can do the same.
* It's technically impossible to encrypt mails to clearnet addresses &lt;ref&gt;Such as gmail, riseup etc.
&lt;/ref&gt;, unless the sender and recipient are using end-to-end encryption such as OpenPGP.
* Therefore it's no more/less secure than using riseup, tormail, etc.
* Even though based on i2p, you can still use it in Whonix over Tor, see [[i2p]] for information how to tunnel i2p over Tor.
* I haven't heard about any e-mail accounts which got suspended. (Well, I don't know about spam abuse, but that's another story.)
* Things said in the ''Threats'' chapter still apply.

== I2P-Bote ==

Is not a classical e-mail provider and deserves its own chapter, see below.

== riseup.net ==

* Recommended by Jacob Appelbaum.
* Works reliable on mailing lists.
* Privacy by policy.
* Tor friendly.
* Servers hosted in the US.
* I haven't heard about any e-mail accounts which got suspended. (Well, I don't know about spam abuse, but that's another story.)
* Things said in the ''Threats'' chapter still apply.

== gmail ==

* Mike Hearn from Google addressed this issue on tor-talk&lt;ref&gt;https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-October/025923.html&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Access to Google accounts via Tor (or any anonymizing proxy service) is not allowed unless you have established a track record of using those services beforehand. You have several ways to do that:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) With Tor active, log in via the web and answer a security question, if any is presented. You may need to receive a code on your phone. If you don't have a phone number on the account the access may be denied.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
2) Log in via the web without Tor, then activate Tor and log in again WITHOUT clearing cookies. The GAPS cookie on your browser is a large random number that acts as a second factor and will whitelist your access.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once we see that your account has a track record of being successfully accessed via Tor the security checks are relaxed and you should be able to use TorBirdy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Recommended against. Not Tor friendly. It would be very difficult to sign up using Tor and to exclusively use it over Tor. They most likely ask for phone verification and this is almost impossible to do without jeopardizing anonymity. &lt;ref&gt;Because they are also aware of online phone and messaging services and blacklisting the for verification upon knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anonymity Friendly E-Mail Provider List ==

Another anonymity network provider (JonDos), maintains a list of their recommended e-mail providers. Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer does NOT check this list. Might still be useful. See [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/thunderbird.html list], look for &quot;Recommended Mail Provider&quot;.

= Bitmessage =
[https://bitmessage.org Bitmesage] might be another alternative to e-mail. See also [[Special:AWCforum/st/id239/Did_bitmassage_work_in_whonix%3F.html|Forum discussion]]. Not yet tested by Whonix developers, because [https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage/issues/108 Bitmessage developers do not yet sign their their source code].

= I2P-Bote =

Quoted from wikipedia I2P&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P&lt;/ref&gt;:

&quot;''I2P-Bote is an I2P-internal, fully decentralized and distributed e-mail system. It supports different identities and does not expose e-mail headers. Currently, it is still alpha software and can only be accessed via its web interface, but POP support is planned. All bote-mails are transparently end-to-end encrypted and, optionally, signed by the sender's public key, thus removing the need for PGP or other privacy software. I2P-Bote offers additional anonymity by allowing for the use of mail relays with variable length delays. As it is decentralized, there is no e-mail server that could link different e-mail identities as communicating with each other (profiling): Even the nodes relaying the mails do not know the sender, and apart from sender and receiver, only the end of the high-latency mail route and the storing nodes will know to whom (which I2P node - the user's IP is still hidden by I2P) the mail is destined. The original sender can have gone offline long before the mail becomes available on the other side.''&quot;

Not yet reviewed by Patrick Schleizer, looks promising.

= Usenet =

== Introduction ==

Interesting parts of Usenet other than discussion, include alt.anonymous.messages, Nym servers and Nym server URL Retrieval.

== alt.anonymous.messages ==

alt.anonymous.messages is a public newsgroups supposed to be used to post encrypted and anonymous messages. Getting anonymity and encrypting the messages is up to the user.

It may sound like a disadvantage, but it's an advantage. In comparison, you can never know how many people are using an e-mail provider. Posting in alt.anonymous.messages everyone knows which messages got posted when, but when done right, no one knows who posted a message and what the content of the message is.

Do not use a web service to read individual messages in alt.anonymous.messages. Use an NNTP client (such as Icedove with TorBirdy). Subscribe to the whole newsgroup and download all messages including headers.

Posting to alt.anonymous.messages can be done using Mixmaster and when it's run inside Whonix-Workstation, it's traffic gets routed through Tor beforehand. See the [[Mixmaster]] article for instructions on using Mixmaster.

Using alt.anonymous.messages could be suspicious by itself, but if you do it right, your adversary may not even know, that you are using it. Since the use of remailer is tunneled through Tor, no one should know, that you are aware of the existence of the remailer network at all.

Further information:

* [[Remailer]]
* [[Mixmaster]]
* [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/privacy/anon-server/faq/use/part7/ Faq]

== Nym server protected e-mail inbox ==

Nym server can illustrated as:

&lt;pre&gt;some@mail.sender sends an mail to alice@nymserver.com

alice@nymserver.com -&gt; mail server A -&gt; mail server B -&gt; ... -&gt; mail server Z -&gt; final@inbox.com&lt;/pre&gt;
It's a kind of protection, a proxy chain in front of an e-mail inbox.

Or in other words, a Nym server provides an e-mail address, where incoming mails are forwarded through a configurable chain of mail servers ([[Remailer]]), while not revealing the recipient's inbox to the sender.

This adds several advantages,

* e-mails can be received, while the e-mail provider is protected from pressure or force of an adversary and
* where the e-mail provider doesn't necessarily know, where the e-mail address has been published
* the e-mail provider doesn't know the sender e-mail address and can only see that the recipient became a mail from a remailer

It is my understanding, that the sender's email address will not be known to the recipient, because the remailer will strip it. (Unless the sender specifies it in the text.) However, the one sender of an e-mail is responsible for their own anonymity.

Another question is, if today's remailer really improve security. &lt;ref&gt;See [[Dev/Anonymity Network]] for explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Please note that Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer can not answer support requests related to Nym servers. This possibility has just been pointed out and wasn't tested in practice. It's a whole different thing than Whonix and very technical, difficult with many stumble points. Please look for another way, if you need support. Setting up Nym is not Whonix specific. Success stories, use cases, comments, improved documentation etc. however is welcome.

== Quicksilver Lite in Whonix / creating a Mixmin nym ==

mirimir&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilderssecurity.com/member.php?u=121604&lt;/ref&gt; posted a guide to wilderssecurity.com forum, see [http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?p=2210463 Installing Quicksilver Lite in Whonix and creating a Mixmin nym].

It's a whole different thing than Whonix and very technical, difficult with many stumble points. Please look for another way, if you need support. Setting up Nym is not Whonix specific. Success stories, use cases, comments, improved documentation etc. however is welcome.

== Nym server URL Retrieval ==

Nym server URL Retrieval is a way to download a web page with high latency and especially when combined with Tor, in theory, safer then Tor alone. In practice, there may be no additional anonymity from today's high latency networks and you could end up being one of the very few people using such, in theory, great services. For explanation about high latency network anonymity see Anonymity Network article&lt;ref&gt;[[Dev/Anonymity Network]].&lt;/ref&gt; Further information on the bottom of [http://www.mixnym.net/ mixnym.net].

== Discussion ==

Quoted from Usenet Wikipedia&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet&lt;/ref&gt;: &quot;''Usenet is a worldwide distributed Internet discussion system.''&quot; The Wikipedia article is worth reading as an introduction.

There are binary groups and non-binary groups. Whonix itself doesn't restrict access to any of those groups. However, the Tor network is banned by some NNTP servers. Binary groups are not covered here, it will be almost impossible to find a free open NNTP server, allowing access to binary groups.

* [https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/news.announce.newusers Usenet FAQ]

== News Reader ==

You can read news groups either using an NNTP client, such as Icedove (+ TorBirdy) or an online reader such as Google Groups. Posting to Usenet using Google Groups is not recommended, it's (almost) impossible or at least very difficult to create an anonymous google account, which is required for posting, because Google requires Tor users to use mobile phone verification, which is not available for anonymous users. Google bans sms to web services as well. I don't know if there are other online hosted NNTP readers, which allow posting for Tor users.

Mixmaster can be used to post to news groups. When it's in Whonix-Workstation following the instructions in the [[Mixmaster]] article, Mixmaster traffic will be even routed through the Tor network.

== NNTP Server ==

An open news server is defined as allowing access to all news discussion groups.

It's difficult to find a free NNTP server even for discussion groups. And no, we are '''not''' looking for a trial. Use search terms like &quot;free NNTP server&quot;. The [http://www.nyx.net/~bkraft/ nyx.net list] may be worth checking, I didn't try any of the servers which require registration. Ideally, the news server supports SSL and does not require registration, such as [https://www.aioe.org/ aioe] or is available as a hidden service. I haven't found any news servers hosted as hidden service, they were all down. While aioe allows reading news groups, it does not allow Tor users to post. I haven't found any open news server allowing Tor users to post. (Use Mixmaster over Tor, see above.)

I haven't got NNTPS (SSL encrypted connection to the NNTP server) to work. &lt;code&gt;Maybe it is an upstream bug.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8069&lt;/ref&gt; This shouldn't be of too much concern. Everything posted to newsgroups is open to the public anyway. An encrypted connection to the NNTP server would only prevent Tor exit relays and their ISP's to tamper with the traffic, well, and login data (username and password) for password protected NNTP servers could get stolen. The NNTP server is untrusted in this threat model anyway.

Unknown if this is specific enough to guess a transparent or isolating proxy is being used or if enough other Tor users run big enough amounts of traffic through Tor. Research before Whonix was created has shown that big amounts of file-sharing traffic were run through Tor. Classical file-sharing tends to have more upload than Whonix, but it's also unknown how many people disabled upload or moved to methods which do not involve much upload, such as file hosters.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circumventing Proxy Obedience Design ==
Knowledge assumed:

* [[Comparison of different Whonix variants]].
* Unsafe Browser: Tails and Liberte Linux contain a so-called Unsafe Browser. The Unsafe Browser does not use Tor. It connects in the clear. It is useful to register on hotspots or to view content in the clear without Tor.
* Exploit against physically isolated Whonix-Gateway: difficult against a bare metal physical isolated Whonix-Gateway. This is because Whonix-Workstation can only access Tor running on Whonix-Gateway. We minimized attack surface, hardening etc. See the whole Security and Hardening page for details.
* TBB stands for Tor Browser Bundle.
* In the following table,
** &quot;{{Code2|Fail}}&quot; is defined as &quot;IP/location of user is compromised.&quot;.
** &quot;{{Code2|Safe}}&quot; is defined as &quot;IP/location of user is hidden behind Tor.&quot;.

Whonix protects against IP/location discovery through root exploits ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware Malware] with root rights) on the Workstation &lt;ref name=workstation /&gt;. This does not mean you should deliberately place yourself at risk to become infected with malware. Do not! It would still make all data inside Whonix-Workstation available to the attacker. Again, Whonix is not a perfect system. It cannot be. Whonix is not unbreakable. What Whonix does is increase the effort required by an attacker to find out the user's real IP address, thus de-anonymizing the user. The following table visualizes the various defense layers provided by Whonix.

= Conclusion =
Different threat model, different implementation, different use cases, although some overlap. Different political and design decisions.

= Statement about Neutrality of this Page =
== General ==
It is difficult to make a 100% neutral comparison since the main contributors to this page are mostly Whonix users. We still believe that having this non-perfect page is better than having no such page. Please also keep in mind that this page also could have been anonymously posted elsewhere (Wikipedia?). The contributors to this page decided to attach their pseudonyms.

We allow anonymous edits, and those we approve are usually published within a short time. Should anything still be wrong, feel free to edit it right away. The whole article is under a Free (as in speech) license, under GPLv3+, so if anyone is interested in editing this page to a more neutral place (such as Wikipedia?), adrelanos would be fine with that. Adrelanos would also agree to dual/multi/re-licensing this page under a different Free (as in speech) license (such as GFDL or so), should that be required. Ironically, moving the article to Wikipedia wouldn't work so well (adrelanos would still be fine with that!), since Wikipedia does not allow edits made by Tor users, and most people interested in this article are Tor users.

== Different views ==
One has always to be very careful, when talking about others. Especially, when talking about advantages and disadvantages. Different opinions are accepted and listed here.

== Comparison of Tor and Proxies ==
=== Introduction ===

Proxy services are particularly famous for this kind of &quot;anonymization on demand&quot;, besides the already mentioned services. They are literally &quot;proxy PCs&quot; which switch communication between your PC and the Internet. They relay your data traffic to the target and send the answer back to your PC so that the web site cannot see your IP address.

=== Comparison ===
This is a brief overview with a comparison of features of proxies, which you can find on many free proxy sharing websites. It's not about the proxy protocol. Not a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of proxies. Some points required for understanding.

Footnotes:

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Not when being used as a transparent proxy. Only when being used as proxy settings. 

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Tor offers a socks5 proxy but Tor does not support UDP.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Some http and https proxies don't even hide your IP, if these are setup to send the '[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN#VPNSSHversusProxy http forwarded for]' header. Proxies not sending http forwarded for, are sometimes called &quot;elite&quot; or &quot;anonymous&quot; proxies.

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; To the destination server, for example to the webserver torproject.org.

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Without user-to-proxy encryption the ISP (internet service provider) or any man-in-the-middle, can see connection details, including destination server IP and package content. (Package content will be only hidden, when end-to-end encryption such as SSL is being used.)

&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Depends on proxy.

&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Not yet supported by the Tor network.

&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Socks interface only available to paying users.

&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; eepsites only. Connections to clearnet only possible through outproxies (no SSL to destination site).

&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; Do not support the connect method (see below). Therefore connections to SSL protected websites is impossible.

&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; https proxy is misleading, as the connection to the proxy is not encrypted. The proxy additionally supports the connect method, which is required to access SSL protected websites and other services than http.

&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; Tor can offer a SocksPort (socks4(a)/5), DnsPort and TransPort. Third party http 2 socks converter (privoxy) available.

&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; For a more detailed review of that network, see [[JonDonym]].

=== Conclusion ===

Other than anonymization services such as JonDo, i2p and Tor, unfortunately, proxies have a high susceptibility to misuse and user data theft: many proxies are PCs hijacked by hackers or criminals, or even exclusively offered for the purpose of user observation. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Even if they were legitimately offered, it would be a security by policy, rather than protection by design - because a single operator can decide to enable logging.

Some proxies automatically give your IP address away to the target webserver &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

Connections with proxies are almost always unencrypted &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, so that an eavesdropper on your connection could observe your surfing behavior. Moreover, the proxy operator can, of course, watch exactly what you are doing. Proxies offer thus, if at all, only weak protection against destination website logging and no protection from third parties eavesdroppers. Their usage is risky.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I am not aware of any http(s) or socks4(a)/5 proxies &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, supporting encryption.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (other than anonymity networks, which use http(s) socks4(a)/5 proxies just as an interface)

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; I haven't found any http(s) or socks4(a)/5 proxies &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as legitimate offer. Most proxies are found on (free) proxy sharing and it's dubious if they those proxies are aware of it want to be listed there or if they are only open proxies. (misconfigured machines) &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (http forwarded for header)

== Comparison of Whonix, Tails, Tor Browser Bundle and CGIproxies ==

=== Introduction ===

Point of view: using them in Mozilla Firefox on the host without using something such as Whonix or Tails.

CGIproxies are webproxy services, Internet pages with a form field in which the user can input the target address that he want's to visit anonymously. The webproxy subsequently delivers the content of the requested website and automatically patches all links to use the webproxy when clicked. For using webproxy services the browser configuration does not have to be changed.

Compared to network proxies, they have the disadvantage not to be able to replace each link correctly, in particular on web sites with JavaScript code. This makes it easier that the user IP address gets &quot;leaked&quot; to the web server, which the proxy should actually prevent. The https://ip-check.info anonymity test displays the weakness of some web proxies in the comparison table.

They could only anonymize browser traffic and not other applications, but to be fair, they don't claim more than anonymizing browser traffic.

=== Comparison ===

=== Conclusion ===

In comparison to Tor, CGIproxies are only a one hop proxies, thus they know who is connecting and where the user connects to. They could read all transmissions, even if entering SSL protected domain names. This makes them much inferior to Tor.

Due to these disadvantages, other security features, which have been discussed above in chapter comparison of Whonix, Tails and Tor Browser bundle, such as UTC timezone, fingerprinting didn't appear worthwhile to compare.

== Comparison of Tor and Proxy Chains ==

=== Aren't 10 proxies (proxychains) better than Tor with only 3 hops? - proxychains vs Tor ===

Maybe you've seen the funny picture &quot;I am behind 10 proxies, so what?&quot;. Nevermind.

10 open proxies are not as secure as Tor. Many people are not aware of that.

As outlined above, proxies are not very secure.

With Tor the first hop won't see the IP of the last hop because it can't decrypt the message for the second hop. If one hop can be trusted, the connection is secure (see the onion design).

Even if you are using &quot;elite&quot; or &quot;anonymous&quot; proxies... Or even Socks Proxies...

* All connections between you and all proxies are unencrypted.
* This has nothing to do with SSL, but for demonstration, let's assume you are connecting to an SSL protected web server.
* In human understandable form, this is a sketch how the package for the first proxy in your chain of 5 would look like:
* Hey Proxy1, can you please forward &quot;forward to Proxy3; forward to Proxy4; forward to Proxy5; forward to https://encrypted.google.com 'c8e8df895c2cae-some-garbage-here-(encrypted)-166bad027fdf15335b'&quot; to Proxy2? Thanks!
* You see, your actual transmission will be safely encrypted and can be only decrypted by the https protected webserver, but every proxy will see it's predecessor IP and all successor IP's.
* There is no way to encrypt that information, no way to make your own onion. The proxy protocols (http(s), socks4(a)/5) do not support encryption.

As you would have to trust any of them the IP of all it's successors... The second question about open proxies is, who hosts them?

* most of them are a simple misconfiguration, the owners are not aware of it and do not want the public to use them
* many of them are compromised machines (worm infected)
* some are honeypots, logging or exploiting (dns spoofing, protocol spoofing, ssl spoofing)
* few of them are are from generous people who just want your best and give you anonymity (similar to most Tor server admins)

This must not apply for proxychains of SSH and/or encrypted VPN servers - has not been researched yet. But you can not get so many SSH and/or VPN servers for free (without hacking of course) and/or anonymous payment anyway.

== Comparison of Tor and VPN services ==

=== Comparison ===

If you run the VPN software directly on the same machine as also the client software such as web browser runs, [[Data_Collection_Techniques#Active_Web_Contents]] can read your real IP address. This can be prevented, if you use a virtual or physical VPN-Gateway or your router. However, please note that active contents may still read a lot of data about your computer and network configuration.

* Some providers force the user to use their proprietary closed source software and have no option to allow being used by reputable VPN software, such as OpenVPN.
* On one hand, their software usually does not ensure, that users also have an uniform appearance on the Web aside their IP address (see [[Data Collection Techniques]]). The users are thus distinguishable and easily identifiable by merging the data.
* And on the other hand, a local observer on your network (ISP, WLAN) could guesstimate websites requested over VPN simply by analyzing size and timing of the encrypted VPN data stream. Tor is quite resilient against this attack (a scientific article which demonstrates the attack is found [http://epub.uni-regensburg.de/11919/1/authorsversion-ccsw09.pdf here]; the success rates are over 90% for VPNs).
* Moreover, VPN systems, as inherent to their functional principle, normally do not filter or replace your computer's TCP packets. They thereby do not protect you from [[Data_Collection_Techniques#TCP_Timestamps|TCP timestamp attacks]] as Tor does.
* Even when using a virtual or physical VPN-Gateway, due to browser fingerprinting problems it's only [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous rather than anonymous]].
* You should also keep in mind that VPN hosts can, unlike Tor, can track and save every step of yours, since they control all servers in the VPN.
* VPN providers only offer privacy by policy, while Tor offers privacy by design. A VPN provider can claim not to log, but you'll never know until it's too late. When using Tor, you also never know, if any of the three hops keeps logs. One malicious node will have less impact. The entry guard will not know where you are connecting to, thus it's not a fatal problem if they log. The exit relay won't know who you are, but can see your unencrypted traffic, which can be a problem if you send sensitive data (which you are advised not to do), but if you act accordingly, it isn't a problem. It's unlikely (thus not impossible), that you choose a circuit where an adversary controls all three nodes. However, while using VPN providers you're putting all trust into the policy of one provider, using Tor distributes trust.
* Don't get fooled by advertisements for Double, Triple or Multi Hop VPNs. Unless it's the user, who builds it's own custom VPN chain by carefully choosing different VPN providers, owned by different companies, you're still fully trusting only one provider.

Whether it's worth to combine Tor with a VPN, either as pre-Tor-VPN (user -&gt; VPN -&gt; Tor) or as post-Tor-VPN (user -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN) is quite a controversial topic and discussed on the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor plus VPN] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FPudSpvr w]) page. In case you decide to do so, it's easy with Whonix, see [[Features#VPN_.2F_Tunnel_support|VPN/Tunnel Support]].

|description=Prevent Identity Correlation through Circuit Sharing by using Tor Stream Isolation
}}

= Stream Isolation =
== Introduction ==
If you do not explicitly take action against this and install custom applications, you risk that different activities, let's say Web (Chromium or similar) or IRC (mIRC or similar) go through the same Tor circuit and exit relay. Even though you would still be anonymous, i.e. the Tor exit relay would still not know your real IP/location, they can easily correlate those activities issued by different applications to the same pseudonym.

The following graphic illustrates the difference of using Tor SocksPort's compared to using Tor's TransPort. Using dedicated SocksPort's per application results in taking different routes through the Tor network per application. Not necessarily all nodes (first, second, third) get replaced by Tor. Sometimes just the first, sometimes just the second, sometimes just the third, and sometimes multiple nodes change.

[[Image:stream_isolation.1.0.jpg|frame|none|alt=|Stream Isolation Graphic]]

Whonix 0.2.1 and above implement protection against {{Code2|identity correlation through circuit sharing}}, however, for better privacy, you are still advised to understand a bit of the technical background. Since Tor version 0.2.3, different Socks,- Dns-, or TransPorts go through different circuits, therefore preventing {{Code2|identity correlation}}. Whonix configures most applications that come preinstalled with Whonix to use different SocksPort, thus no {{Code2|identity correlation}} is at risk. Whonix uses either socks proxy settings to direct various applications to different SocksPorts or uwt (more information below).

Any other traffic (i.e. custom installed applications, misc applications, such as {{Code2|nslookup}}, go through Tor's Dns-, and/or TransPort (can be optionally disabled, see below).

Applications in Whonix 0.2.1 and above configured to prevent {{Code2|identity correlation through circuit sharing}}:

Changing proxy settings in Tor Browser has proven to be unreliable. At some point Tor Button may change its internals and therefore break something again. Keeping the default settings and not requiring any changes in Tor Browser seems like the best way to support compatibility in long run and also is simplest in case {{Code|update-torbrowser}} breaks and [[Manually_Updating_Tor_Browser|manually updating Tor Browser]] is required again in future.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whonix 6 and above: KDE application wide proxy settings (no KDE applications with network activity pre-installed, pre-configured socks proxy settings, port 9122)

Whonix 6 and above: GNOME application wide proxy settings (no GNOME applications with network activity pre-installed, [[Dev/GNOME|not pre-configured]], port prepared, port 9123)

The required socks proxy settings were setup by the Whonix build scripts. uwt wrappers are set up on Whonix-Gateway and on Whonix-Workstation under {{Code|/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_uwt}}. [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/torsocks uwt] is a wrapper around torsocks, which is also already installed to {{Code|/usr/bin/uwt}}.

* Example, each time you run a uwt wrapped application, i.e. simply type {{Code2|apt-get}} in console, the uwt wrapper {{Code|/usr/bin/apt-get}} will run. It adds uwt before apt-get. For curiosity check {{Code|nano /usr/bin/apt-get}}. The uwt wrapper then runs {{Code|/usr/bin/uwt /usr/bin/apt-get.real}}. That is also the case for all other uwt wrapped applications.
* If you ever want or must run a uwt wrapped application without uwt, do not run for example {{Code|apt-get}} in console, do run {{Code|apt-get.real}}. Use cases could be if you want to connect to localhost. If you know what you are doing, you should also be able to deactivate any uwt wrappers you dislike, see [[#Deactivate_uwt_Stream_Isolation_Wrapper]].
* When running {{Code2|/usr/bin/apt-get.real}} directly it goes through Tor's DnsPort and through Tor's TransPort and not through its own SocksPort.
* uwt looks if the command contains the words {{Code2|localhost}} or {{Code2|127.0.0.1}}, if that is the case, uwt will not be used. The command will be run without uwt. Thus, if a localhost connection is falsely detected it will leak, but only through Tor's DnsPort and through Tor's TransPort, which should be ok.

Isolate by destination address: Let's assume SSH goes over port 22 and you want to connect to different SSH servers and do not want an observer to be able to correlate that activity to the same pseudonym. If the SSH servers run on different IP's isolate by destination address might help.

Isolate by destination port: This doesn't seem to be useful for anything in Whonix, applications using different protocols (and therefore different ports) are already isolated through using different SOCKSPorts.

Isolate by destination port doesn't really achieve anything for web browsing: [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024403.html tor-talk Tor's stream isolation features defaults].

For more information about stream isolation refer to the Tor manual.

=== Tor Browser ===

Different tabs and websites in Tor Browser are not isolated until Tor upstream feature &quot;Tor Browser should set SOCKS username for a request based on referer&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3455&lt;/ref&gt; gets implemented. Limited workarounds are described below.

=== Custom Software ===

If you install custom software on Whonix-Workstation, and want to prevent {{Code2|identity correlation through circuit sharing}} (which you should do), you have to manually configure them. This is not a Whonix specific problem. &lt;ref&gt;If you used to use only one SocksPort with the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO common torification methods], the [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023535.html same thing happened].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Also the current (March 2012) [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en Tor Browser Bundle] is affected, all Firefox Tabs can be correlated to the same identity until the circuit is automatically changed by Tor.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://tails.boum.org/ Tails], which is officially listed on torproject.org was [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023535.html also affected]. Tails done [https://tails.boum.org/todo/separate_Tor_streams/ Todo] item.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to mitigate identity correlation ==

=== Basic Protection ===

Most applications which come with Whonix 0.2.1 and above are already configured to prevent {{Code2|identity correlation through circuit sharing}}, you really should read the introduction above.

The only traffic going through TransPort by default is [[whonixcheck]] when testing the TransPort. If that is of concern to you, it can be disabled in whonixcheck. Just comment out the &quot;{{Code2|check_tor &quot;TransPort&quot;}}&quot; in {{Code2|/usr/bin/whonixcheck}} in that case.

All custom installed application's TCP traffic is routed through Tor's TransPort and all their DNS requests through Tor's DnsPort. This means different activities or &quot;identities&quot; in different applications (say browser, IRC, email) end up being routed through the same circuit, thus {{Code2|identity correlation}} is at risk.

To protect against this, you have to set up per-application SOCKS ports in Whonix-Gateway.

On Whonix-Gateway in {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/stable/whonix_gateway/etc/tor/torrc on github]) are already a lot custom socks ports prepared for custom installed applications:

* Without {{Code2|IsolateDestAddr}} and without {{Code2|IsolateDestPort}}: SocksPort 192.168.0.10:9152 to 9159
* With {{Code2|IsolateDestAddr}}, but without {{Code2|IsolateDestPort}}: SocksPort 192.168.0.10:9160 to 9169
* Without {{Code2|IsolateDestAddr}}, but with {{Code2|IsolateDestPort}}: SocksPort: 192.168.0.10:9170 to 9179
* With {{Code2|IsolateDestAddr}} and with {{Code2|IsolateDestPort}}: SocksPort: 192.168.0.10:9180 to 9189
* If they those are not enough, you can add your own ones.

What are {{Code2|IsolateDestAddr}} and {{Code2|IsolateDestPort}}? You can learn about them in the [https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en Tor manual]. See also [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024403.html tor-talk mailing list: Tor's stream isolation features defaults]. Usually, unless you know better, you are better off not using {{Code2|IsolateDestAddr}} or {{Code2|IsolateDestPort}}.

You can point your applications, where you want to prevent {{Code2|identity correlation though circuit sharing}}, to those SocksPorts. Each custom installed application has to be torified, for directions how to do that use the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO Torify HOWTO].

Additional comments regarding the Torify HOWTO:

* Warnings about protocol related warnings you must honor. You are still better off with Whonix, as it offers best possible [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Whonix's setup provides protection against IP leaks through [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Protocolleaks protocol leaks].
* If you do not correctly torify, no connections will be possible.
* If you redirect more than one application to the same SocksPort, {{Code2|identity correlation}} is at risk.
* DNS related [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorFAQ#IkeepseeingthesewarningsaboutSOCKSandDNSandinformationleaks.ShouldIworry warnings] still apply, though to a lesser extent - an attack could only make correlations but still couldn't figure out your IP. You can prevent that, be out commenting (# in front) DnsPort in {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} on the Whonix-Gateway and by removing the DNS redirection firewall rule from {{WhonixFirewall}}.
** Do not use a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/SupportPrograms#DNS local DNS resolver], as all DNS requests would be executed by the same circuit.
* Other leaks, such as applications not honoring the proxy settings / wrapper, ICMP or UDP leaks do not apply to Whonix.

=== Better Protection ===

For best protection against {{Code2|identity correlation}}:

Read the advice above and on Whonix-Gateway:

Deactivate KDE / GNOME - application wide proxy settings...

* Whonix {{Whonix6}} and above: Because those proxy settings are not application specific, but rather force all KDE / GNOME applications through the same SocksPort (no KDE / GNOME applications which use the internet preinstalled by default), deactivating those KDE / GNOME - wide proxy settings gives better control about stream isolation.

To deactivate TransPort and DnsPort...

* See {{Code2|WORKSTATION_TRANSPARENT_TCP}} in {{Code2|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}}.
* See {{Code2|WORKSTATION_TRANSPARENT_DNS}} in {{Code2|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}}.
* Reload whonix_firewall ({{Code|sudo /usr/bin/whonix_firewall}}) or simply reboot.

Although not strictly required, you could additionally, comment out:

* TransPort in '''TODO''': {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}} (this file may get overwritten when Whonix gets updated) or {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}
* DnsPort in '''TODO''': {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}} (this file may get overwritten when Whonix gets updated) or {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}
* And restart Tor. ({{Code2|sudo service tor restart}})

This will disable transparent proxying. All applications not configured to use a SocksPort or forced to use a SocksPort (use uwt) will not be able to establish connections. This is the only way to ensure, that different SocksPorts are used and that also DNS is remotely resolved through that SocksPort.

=== Total protection ===

Total protection is only possible, if you honor the advice above and only use one application per session and always revert to a fresh snapshot or use [[Tor_Browser#More_than_one_Tor_Browser_in_Whonix | more than one Whonix-Workstation]]. [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]] (using different internal IP's) are automatically separated by Tor (IsolateClientAddr is Tor's default).

=== Limited workarounds for Tor Browser ===

==== Possible ====
1. Weakest: Close Tor Browser, go to Whonix-Gateway, start [[Tor Controller|arm]], press &quot;n&quot; for new identity, restart Tor Browser. (Will be simpler in next Whonix version, Tor Buttons new identity feature will just work.)

2. Better: Install a second browser and configure it to use its own SocksPort, see [[Tor_Browser#More_than_one_Tor_Browser_in_Whonix|More than one Tor Browser in Whonix]].

3. Even better: Use [[multiple Whonix-Workstations]].

==== IsolateDestAddr and IsolateDestPort for Tor Browser (Recommended against!) ====

'''(Recommended against!)''' If you are interested anyway, see footnote &lt;ref&gt;'''(Recommended against!)'''
As a workaround you could enable IsolateDestAddr and IsolateDestPort for the Tor Browser.

This comes at great performance costs, especially for websites with lots of 3rd party content. It will not isolate connections to different websites on a shared server and it will create new circuits for every IP address you connect to (e.g. it will isolate subdomains if they use different IPs). It will also let you stand out more from other Tor Browser users, because almost no one is using it that way. Generally, for these reasons you should not enable this feature. Instead close the browser and get a &quot;new identity&quot; through arm on the gateway if you want to separate activities inside Tor Browser. If you want to do this anyway, follow the following instructions.

On Whonix-Gateway open {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}'.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add.

&lt;pre&gt;
SocksPort 192.168.0.10:9150 IsolateDestAddr IsolateDestPort
&lt;/pre&gt;

Save.

Reload Tor.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service tor reload
&lt;/pre&gt;

Done.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Deactivate uwt Stream Isolation Wrapper ==
'''OPTIONAL. Usually not required. Only for special setups and people who know what they are doing.'''

You can enable/disable all uwt stream isolation wrappers globally or enable/disable specific stream isolation wrappers, see uwt {{Code|/etc/whonix.d/30_uwt_default}} configuration file.

== Development ==
=== Tests ===
1. Applications which internally use curl.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo update-command-not-found

sudo update-flashplugin-nonfree --install --verbose
&lt;/pre&gt;

2. Applications which is uwt wrapped itself and internally uses ssh.

&lt;pre&gt;
git push origin master
&lt;/pre&gt;

3. Enigmail.

=== Debugging / List of all uwt wrappers ===
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg-divert --list
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
ls -la /usr/bin/ssh
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Deactivating an uwt wrapper ===
Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo unlink /usr/bin/ssh
sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/bin/ssh
&lt;/pre&gt;

= SSL =
== User Documentation ==
SSL in Wikipedia &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security&lt;/ref&gt;

The public SSL certificate authority system is not to be trusted. Too many security breaches happened before. &lt;ref&gt;See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar DigiNotar], [http://www.scmagazine.com/two-more-comodo-resellers-owned-in-ssl-hack/article/199620/ Comodo] and [http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/google-fraudulent-certificate/ Turktrust].&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[Warning#Man-in-the-middle_attacks|Man-in-the-middle attacks]].

== Whonix Technical Design ==
SSL certificates, especially for https://check.torproject.org (check.tpo) are not yet pinned in Whonix. Eventually that will be done in future. That needs some more discussion. How that technically could be done is documented under [[Dev/SSL Certificate Pinning]]. This has low priority for Whonix, since not even the Tor Browser Bundle does pin the check.tpo SSL certificate, which is a much bigger issue. Whonix developer adrelanos does not agree with &quot;low priority&quot; in TBB. See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3555 TBB: hardcode SSL cert check to prevent MITM].

= Introduction =
{{Code2|whonixcheck}} is a bash script, checking many important things. Supports to be run in console and also has a grapical progress meter and graphical info popup for the results. It's stored in {{Code|/usr/bin/whonixcheck}} and in {{Code|/usr/lib/whonix/whonixcheck/}}. Whonix will also work without that script. It's only checks things, it doesn't change things. Nothing is compiled, it's just a script and anyone can read the source code.

The whonixcheck script was inspired by https://check.torproject.org. In past when people were still recommended to use proxy settings to torify web browsers, it was an important check. While manual torification of web browsers is nowadays recommended against, the Tor Browser Bundle, which is securely pre-configured, still visits check.tpo and checks if everything is okay. Check.tpo also checks if the Tor Browser Bundle version is up to date (technically Tor Button downloads version information and checks locally).

While check.tpo just checks the browser, Whonix is more than a browser. It's a complete operating system. Therefore when the browser starts, it's already too late. It has to be checked earlier, because the user might not start the browser. That's why whonixcheck will be automatically started after boot/login (if it hasn't been recently run, i.e. if whonxicheck has been completed within 24 hours earlier).

whonixcheck will run once every day, even if the system is not restarted. The motivation behind that is also to inform long running systems.

Some users wish to hide the fact from their ISP, they they are using Tor and Whonix. See [[Hide Tor and Whonix from your ISP]] article. While only a fraction of users goes through the procedures to hide Tor, it is still desirable to hide the fact they're using Whonix. We're better of if adversaries can't distinguish between lets say TBB and Whonix users. When whonixcheck is automatically started, it waits a randomized amount of time (between 60 and 500 seconds). Although it would be Tor's job to prevent any kinds of conclusions from the amount of traffic and the traffic pattern, this feature is supposed to aid to obfuscation of that kind of traffic analysis. Starting Tor and instantly having a lot of traffic (from whonixcheck) might be easier to distinguish than waiting a randomized amount of time until that kind of traffic flows.

= Checks =
* If run either on bare metal ([[Physical Isolation]]) or inside VirtualBox. Warns when using an unsupported (by Whonix developers) virtualizer.
* Whonix 7.7.1.1 and above: checks if the clock source is KVMClock and warns if that is the case. Might probably only happen for users using the [[KVM]] instructions. Reports only if KVMClock is detected. Otherwise quiet.
* Check the validity of Tor's config files by using &quot;sudo tor --verify-config&quot;. Whonix-Gateway only. Reports only error. Otherwise quiet.
* Whonix 7.7.1.1 and above: Check if a package manager is currently running. Waits as long as a package manager is running until it continues. It waits, because the Tor package or [[Dev/CPFP]] is currently upgraded, connection checks would fail.
* Check if the Tor process is running. Only on Whonix-Gateway. Reports error if not. Quiet otherwise.
* Tor connection / IP
** Tor Bootstrap Status
** downloads https://check.torproject.org with curl through extra SocksPort
** downloads https://check.torproject.org with curl through TransPort
** The Whonix design ensures, that never the users real IP can be detected. Why check it anyway? Sometimes check.tpo reports false positives and fails to detect Tor exit nodes. The user should be informed about that possibility. That reduces support requests and bad press. It's fine to investigate if the Tor exit node could not be detected, but we're quite confident, that the outcome will be, that it's a Tor exit node IP. Some users may do dangerous and/or unsupported things, such as changing Whonix-Workstation's network interface from {{Code|internal}} network {{Code|&quot;Whonix&quot;}} to {{Code|bridged}} or {{Code|NAT}} or other creative and adventurous things, such as using virtualizers which are entirely unsupported and untested by Whonix developers. Last but not least, users can and are encouraged to install upgrades using {{Code|apt-get}} and free to install arbitrary packages on Whonix-Workstation. In a totally unexpected case, that may open up for a leak and whonixcheck is Whonix's last layer of defenses against such leaks.
* Tor Browser version
** downloads https://check.torproject.org/RecommendedTBBVersions with curl through extra SocksPort
* operating system updates
** Run ''apt-get update'' through apt-get SocksPort and inform about the system being up to date or requiring updates.
* Whonix version and Whonix news
** Downloads Whonix News Files with curl through extra whonix news SocksPort.
** Is supposed to reflect most important news for people not even following Whonix Important Blog. In theory, if an IP leak in Whonix where found or exit nodes actively exploiting apt-get traffic, this would be used to briefly inform users about the danger.
** [[Dev/News|Whonix News Format]]
** Whonix version and news file must be signed by Whonix developer adrelanos.
** Adrelanos gpg key got copied to whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/keys/whonix-keys.d/ at build time.
** Warns if the file can not be gpg verified with adrelanos gpg key. In that case version and news is ignored.
** Also see [[Trust]].
** An adversary with (temporary) control over the sourceforge.net server could replace that file with any other message ever signed by adrelanos. Below Whonix 7.7.1.1: There is no defense against this attack, but a defense wouldn't be useful anyway. &lt;ref&gt;An adversary in that position could run even more powerful attacks, such as malicious website news and documentation, malicious downloads&lt;/ref&gt; Whonix 7.7.1.1 and above: Messages signed more than one month ago are rejected and the user is informed about the message being no longer valid.

= Security =
The ''ca-certificates'' Debian package is installed on Whonix. Curl will verify the SSL certificate for downloads from check.tpo (SocksPort Test, TransPort Test, Tor Browser version check) and aborts if the certificate is not valid.

Attack surface for this script includes at least curl, apt-get, gpg, grep, sed, bash, uwt, torsocks, zenity, pgrep. Adrelanos believes, that benefits outweigh the risks not running those checks. The user is free to ''sudo chmod -x /usr/bin/whonixcheck'' and adrelanos remains as always open for reviews and suggestions.

Also see [[SSL]].

= Debugging =
If you think whonixcheck is stuck, it most likely isn't. Just {{Code2|apt-get update}} sometimes needs a very long time. In any case, you can check it's latest status messages here.

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /var/lib/whonix/whonixcheck/whonixcheck_message_x

|description=Manually creating Whonix without using Whonix's build script or downloads.
}}

This is just a '''draft, unfinished!''' Just some ideas. Unlikely to be ever finished. For special setups and advanced users only. Only in case the [[Download]] version, [[Other Operating Systems]], [[Physical Isolation]] or [[Dev/Build Documentation]] instructions are not suitable, for example if you like to use another distribution as the base for Whonix-Gateway. [[Dev/Build Anonymity]] has not been considered.

This assumes Whonix 7 or above.

[[Dev/Source Code Intro]] contains a source code introduction.

Look into Whonix source code. It's mostly an installing and copy and paste task.

Look into the source file ./build-steps/45_create-vbox-vm. See function general_setup to see which commands are used to create both Virtual Machines, apply hardware_modifications on both machines, and also apply gateway_specific or workstation_specific accordingly.

After installing the operating system...

* Packages listed in /home/user/Whonix/development/Whonix-Gateway_packages have to be installed on Whonix-Gateway.
* Packages listed in /home/user/Whonix/development/Whonix-Workstation_packages have to be installed on Whonix-Workstation.

All files within whonix_gateway folder are configuration files supposed to be installed on Whonix-Gateway. For example /home/user/Whonix/whonix_gateway/etc/tor/torrc is supposed to be installed on Whonix-Gateway under {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

All files within whonix_workstation folder are configuration files supposed to be installed on Whonix-Workstation. For example /home/user/Whonix/whonix_workstation/usr/local/bin/xchat-reset is supposed to be copied to /usr/local/bin/xchat-reset on Whonix-Workstation.

whonix_shared are configuration files supposed to be installed on Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. For example /home/user/Whonix/whonix_shared/etc/sudoers.d/whonix is supposed to be copied to /etc/sudoers.d/whonix on Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

You don't have to bother with most other files in Whonix source folder.&lt;ref&gt;Those are used for image creation and Virtual Machine creation. &lt;/ref&gt; Just read README and LICENSE.

Chroot Scripts...

* /whonix_gateway/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d are run inside Whonix-Gateway
* /whonix_workstation/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d are run inside Whonix-Workstation
* /whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d are run inside Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation
* There are also chroot-scripts-post.d folders. 

You can also read the scripts and only run the commands you find sensible manually one by one.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install kwave
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Printing and Scanning ==

Printing is risky. This is not a Whonix related issues. It is a general issue with printers.

Quotes from eff.org&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/issues/printers&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Imagine that every time you printed a document it automatically included a secret code that could be used to identify the printer - and potentially the person who used it. Sounds like something from an episode of &quot;Alias&quot; right?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Unfortunately the scenario isn't fictional.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don't know if scanners also add such a kind of extra hidden data.

If you want to be secure side, buy an extra printer/scanner, which you only use for anonymous activity.

Another non-technical issue with anonymous printing nowadays is forensic, fingerprint, DNA, etc.

== scurl - SSL command line downloader ==
'''Advanced users.'''

Pre-installed.

It's a simple wrapper around curl. {{Code|/usr/bin/scurl}} simply adds &lt;code&gt;--tlsv1 --proto =https&lt;/code&gt; to all runs of curl. It also has [[Stream Isolation]] in Whonix, because {{Code|/usr/bin/curl}} is an {{Code|uwt wrapper}} symlinked to {{Code|/usr/lib/whonix/uwtwrapper}} which will ultimately run {{Code|/usr/bin/curl.real}}.

To invoke it.

&lt;pre&gt;scurl https://check.torproject.org&lt;/pre&gt;

All other curl/linux features continue to work, such as.

&lt;pre&gt;scurl https://check.torproject.org &gt; index.html&lt;/pre&gt;

To store the output inside a file.

&lt;pre&gt;scurl http://check.torproject.org&lt;/pre&gt;

Will result as expected in.

&lt;pre&gt;curl: (1) Protocol http not supported or disabled in libcurl&lt;/pre&gt;

Same for.

&lt;pre&gt;scurl check.torproject.org&lt;/pre&gt;

Will result as expected in.

&lt;pre&gt;curl: (1) Protocol http not supported or disabled in libcurl&lt;/pre&gt;

Running it against an self-signed or invalid SSL certificate.

&lt;pre&gt;scurl https://www.debian-administration.org&lt;/pre&gt;

Will result in an error, for example.

&lt;pre&gt;
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate
More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a &quot;bundle&quot;
 of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
 bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
 using the --cacert option.
If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
 the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
 problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
 not match the domain name in the URL).
If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
 the -k (or --insecure) option.
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Introduction ==

XChat&lt;ref&gt;http://xchat.org/&lt;/ref&gt; in Whonix has been hardened according to TorifyHOWTO/XChat&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat&lt;/ref&gt;. All servers, besides the secure (SSL) version of OFTC have been removed. You are encouraged to add the secure version of your IRC server. (Preferably a hidden service, SSL as a fallback or at best, both.) See also [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat TorifyHOWTO/XChat].

On OFTC is the official #Tor. Note that no Whonix developers hang out there! Upstream Tor developers do not support Whonix. For contacting Whonix developers, see [[Contact | Contacting Whonix developers / Feedback / Questions]].

== How to start XChat ==

Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; Internet -&gt; XChat IRC

== Reset your XChat idenity ==

If you want to reset your XChat identity.
WARNING: this will kill XChat, delete all your settings, scripts and logs and creates a fresh XChat identity.
Run.

&lt;pre&gt;xchat-reset&lt;/pre&gt;

== SASL ==
Some networks, some hidden IRC servers, such as freenode, require SASL to connect to them.

Setting up SASL is outside the scope of this document, have a look into [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat TorifyHOWTO/XChat].

All XChat plugins have been deactivated (hardening) and deactivated using dpkg-divert. To re-enable them, use one of the following commands depending on which plugin you need.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/python.so
sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/tcl.so
sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/perl.so
&lt;/pre&gt;

Those commands are reverted when Whonix Debian Packages get updated. TODO: How to prevent that.

|description=Installing additional Software on Whonix. Safety considerations.
}}
= Easy =

One of the main goals of Whonix is to greatly reduce the risk through any (additional) software not exclusively designed to use with Tor.

You can install any software inside Whonix-Workstation using ''apt-get'', since it's based on Debian.

Whonix is currently the safest method to run Tor-unsafe applications such as Adobe Flash (see the [[Comparison_with_Others#Flash_.2F_Browser_Plugin_Security|comparison]]).

This is '''not''' a recommendation for installing additional software.

On the [[Software]] page you'll find:

* Applications for different tasks, which are already installed on Whonix by default.
* Software recommendations for different tasks.
* Safety advice.
* Installation instructions.

= More Security =

== Introduction ==

Installing additional software... (see the [[Comparison_with_Others#Security|comparison]])

'''Advantages:'''

* You can install your favorite software packages. Almost any application with a few exceptions listed under [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Howtotorifyspecificprograms impossible to torify].
* You are protected from IP and DNS leaks. (Read above for details.)
* You have some, but no perfect [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].

'''Disadvantages:'''

* You should still try to prevent any other [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Protocolleaks protocol leaks] using the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO TorifyHOWTO] (but most of those are mitigated by using Whonix).
* When you are updating using apt-get, you'll leak which software packages and versions you have installed, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Softwareupdaters Software updaters]. This information can not be directly linked to any other activity, such as web browsing, because the Whonix apt-get uwt wrapper forces apt-get to go through its own circuit. But there are still risks for [[Stream Isolation|correlation]] to the same pseudonym. &lt;ref&gt;For example, if you announced somewhere, that you are an X user and have a specific set of x, y, and z installed, this information may be available to an adversary. If you run apt-get (which goes through its own circuit) through any exit relays, mirrors or ISP's controlled by the adversary, it's possible for the adversary to guess, that it's the same pseudonym, which is running it. In that case the adversary gets your list of installed packages, can run stale mirror attack (only if you are using a custom build using Ubuntu, see About Ubuntu), or can try other attacks against apt-get.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Another example, if you run a hidden service with a specific set of server software, let's say apache, mediawiki, phpbb, x, y, z... it's similar to the previous note.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If you install additional software, you always increase the attack surface&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface&lt;/ref&gt;.

You should update using the guidelines [[#How to install or update with most caution?|below]].

Extra care is needed when adding extra custom repositories, especially PPA's (Personal Package Archives). Single developers may be pressured and/or turn malicious more easily than the main repositories.

Read [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]] first! (Many leaks, such as DNS and IP related leaks do not apply to Whonix; etc.)

The [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO TorifyHOWTO] contains documentation about [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Protocolleaks protocol leaks] and how to mitigate them.

Also see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks]. (Mostly Microsoft Windows related)

== How to install or update with most caution? ==

# Stop all your activities. &lt;ref&gt;One way to do it is using Arm (see [[Tor Controller]]): Go to your Whonix-Gateway and start &lt;code&gt;arm&lt;/code&gt;. Press ''m'' for menu, go down to ''New Identity'' and press enter.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Change your circuit. &lt;ref&gt;Maybe not, if you're running a hidden service?&lt;/ref&gt;
# Update using apt-get after a random delay.
# Change your circuit again.
# Continue your activities later with a random delay.

= Whonix-Workstation is firewalled =
'''This is just an informational chapter if you are interested in server software or other advanced or otherwise uncommon applications.'''

This means:

* does not support incoming connections
** however, if you make outgoing connections, the following incoming connections are accepted (web browsing, irc, etc. works)
** so called server ports
** or also called open ports
** Ident Protocol / web server listening port is not reachable, unless you explicitly configure it
* you can host [[Hidden Services]]
* the firewall can be found on the Whonix-Gateway {{WhonixFirewall}}
* Standard DNS requests on UDP port 53 will be redirected to Tor's DnsPort. If you change the DNS server in /etc/resolv.conf in Whonix-Workstation, this will probably have no effect, since the firewall on Whonix-Gateway will redirect all those requests to Tor's DnsPort. (However, if you are tunneling/encrypting a DNS request, as per [[Secondary DNS Resolver]] (DNSCrypt, httpsdnsd) it will work.)

Also note:

* Tor does not support UDP. This is not a Whonix issue. &lt;ref name=onioncat&gt;Perhaps [[OnionCat]] with Whonix can be a suitable workaround.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tor does not support IPv6. This is not a Whonix issue. &lt;ref name=onioncat /&gt;
* {{TorifiedGateway}} (&lt;-- read the footnotes)

Whonix's firewall on the Whonix-Gateway is very restrictive. You can make it even more restrictive by activating #OptionalFeatureNr.3# within the firewall script. It's possible to limit, which outgoing ports will be redirected to Tor's TransPort. Depending on what you want to achieve, it could be useful to remove all SocksPorts.

|description=Old Archived Build Documentation of Whonix
}}

= Deprecated =
'''This is an outdated version. Go to [[Dev/Build Documentation]].'''

Source code archived on github for historical reasons. Signed (by adrelanos) tag 0.1.3 available.

0.1.3 does not work anymore, because Tor 0.2.3 was released and changes to torrc are required.

'''Source Code:''' https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/0.1.3

'''Download:''' https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/archive/0.1.3.zip

= Obsolete =

This page documents how the [Download binary distribution images] are built.

Following these instructions will always build the latest available version. The scripts used to build a certain version of a Tor-Gateway or Tor-Workstation image can be found in the VM at /usr/share/doc/torbox and through the wiki history. If you only want to build images for your own use you can type any password you want right away during installation instead of first using &quot;changeme&quot; (but you must choose the username &quot;user&quot;), same goes for the keyboard layout.

If you have any questions or need help let us know [/Dev#Questions here].

Knowledge assumed: Virtualization and networking basic principles; operation of your platform; Linux knowledge: how to install Ubuntu and basic command line knowledge.

Only two prerequisites: you need to have VirtualBox installed and you need a working internet connection.

For discussion related to the development and build process of TorBOX images go [/Dev/ClientVM here].

= Build Security =

* Build on a dedicated build system, install security updates...
* All install media and all downloaded/used code must be verified (including all software on the host)
* Hashes or fingerprints listed on the wiki are not to be trusted, same goes for the scripts, verify them (and make use of the history feature)

= Host preparation =

We recommend you to use a dedicated OS installation just for hosting the TorBOX VMs (See [/SecurityAndHardening TorBOX/SecurityAndHardening])

Install the latest security updates, install VirtualBox and reboot to apply kernel updates.

'''Read and apply if necessary [/Readme#NetworkTimeSyncing &quot;Network Time Syncing&quot;]!

''' If you use Debian/Ubuntu: {{{ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade sudo apt-get install virtualbox sudo reboot }}}

'''If you use Windows as the host'''

Download all security updates, install an antivirus... usual security recommendations apply.

Download and verify required software: * [https://www.virtualbox.org/ VirtualBoX] * SSH and SCP, we recommend [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html PuTTY and PSCP]

= Create Tor-Gateway.ova =

== Installation ==

Download and verify [http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server/download ubuntu-11.10-server-i386.iso] &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

,,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Other Linux flavors will also work such as Debian stable, Debian testing, etc. This is untested and will require slight changes to the shell script (see comments in the script).

Following settings are used (if nothing is specified choose default settings/selections)

&lt;pre&gt;VM Settings:
Name: Tor-Gateway
Ubuntu, 2 GB Disk, 128 MB RAM
Leave Adapter 1 as NAT
Add port forwarding for ssh: within the &quot;Adapter 1&quot; tab click &quot;Advanced&quot;, then Port Forwarding. Insert a new rule as follows: 
Name: SSH; Protocol: TCP; Host IP: 127.0.0.1; Host Port: 2222; Guest IP: leave blank; Guest Port: 22 
Enable Adapter 2, set to &quot;Internal Network&quot;
Disable &quot;System-&gt;Enable absolute pointing device&quot;, then disable &quot;USB-&gt; Enable USB Controller&quot;
Close Settings window and start the VM:
In the boot menu press F4 and select &quot;Install a minimal system&quot;
Language English
United States
keyboard layout English (US) (don't autodetect)
Primary network interface: eth0
Hostname: ubuntu
Timezone:UTC
Partitioning: Guided - use entire disk (Not LVM!)
Username: user
Password: changeme
encrypt home folder: No
No automatic updates 
tasksel: select nothing&lt;/pre&gt;
== Configuration ==

Log in and install the latest security updates and reboot to apply kernel upgrades. (run on the guest)

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get --yes dist-upgrade
sudo reboot&lt;/pre&gt;
It is recommended that you install a ssh server at this point so you can copy and paste commands from host: (run on the guest)

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install openssh-server&lt;/pre&gt;
Transfer [/Dev/TGScript tor-gateway.sh] to /home/user (run on the host)

&lt;pre&gt;scp -P 2222 tor-gateway.sh user@127.0.0.1:/home/user/&lt;/pre&gt;
(Instead of using scp you can also log in via ssh, open nano and copy and paste the script, save as tor-gateway.sh; exit)

Now you can log in from the host with (run on the host)

&lt;pre&gt;ssh -p 2222 user@127.0.0.1&lt;/pre&gt;
Import GPG key for the Torproject repository: Do not simply trust the [https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en fingerprint] you found here. [https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en#ubuntu Verify] that it is correct! (run on the guest)

&lt;pre&gt;gpg --keyserver x-hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 886DDD89
gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -&lt;/pre&gt;
Before executing read through the script to check for errors (or malicious edits)!

&lt;pre&gt;nano tor-gateway.sh&lt;/pre&gt;
Run tor-gateway.sh directly on a terminal, not through ssh! (run on the guest)

&lt;pre&gt;chmod +x tor-gateway*.sh
sudo ./tor-gateway.sh -vm&lt;/pre&gt;
If you install on bare metal omit the &quot;-vm&quot;.

Wait till it says &quot;Tor-Gateway configuration successful.&quot; If the script fails you probably forgot to attach the second adapter or to import the gpg key or your internet connection is down. After fixing that simply run the script again. If it still fails please let us know on [/Dev TorBOX/Dev]!

== Final Steps ==

* remove port forwarding
* Poweroff. In Network-&gt;Adapter 2: rename the network to &quot;torbox&quot;

Skip the following if you build for your own use and not for redistribution. (run on the guest) * sudo mv ./tor-gateway.sh /usr/share/doc/torbox * set password to &quot;changeme&quot; if a different one was used before (use the command passwd) * rm .bash_history (you need to log out and back in first for this to have any effect) * Export the VM, save as Tor-Gateway.ova * [/TestAndTroubleshoot Test] the image before release!

= Create Tor-Workstation.ova =

== Installation ==

Download and verify ubuntu-11.10-server-i386.iso

Following settings are used (if nothing is specified choose default settings)

&lt;pre&gt;VM Settings: 
Name: Tor-Workstation
Ubuntu, 8 GB Disk, 512 MB RAM
In Settings-&gt;Network Leave Adapter 1 as NAT (faster apt-get downloads during set up)
Enter following MAC address: 080027070b08
Add port forwarding for ssh: within the &quot;Adapter 1&quot; tab click &quot;Advanced&quot;, then Port     Forwarding. Insert a new rule as follows: 
Name: SSH; Protocol: TCP; Host IP: 127.0.0.1; Host Port: 4444; Guest IP: leave blank; Guest Port: 22
In the boot menu press F4 and select &quot;Install a minimal system&quot;
Language English
United States
Keyboard layout English (US)
Hostname: ubuntu
Timezone: UTC
Partitioning: Guided - use entire disk (Not LVM!)
Username: user
Password: changeme
encrypt home folder: No
No automatic updates 
tasksel: select nothing&lt;/pre&gt;
== Configuration ==

Log in and install the latest security updates and reboot to apply kernel upgrades. (run on the guest)

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get --yes dist-upgrade
sudo reboot&lt;/pre&gt;
It is recommended that you install a ssh server at this point so you can copy and paste commands from host: (run on the guest)

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install openssh-server&lt;/pre&gt;
Transfer [/Dev/TWScript tor-workstation.sh] to /home/user (run on the host)

&lt;pre&gt;scp -P 4444 tor-workstation.sh user@127.0.0.1:/home/user/&lt;/pre&gt;
(Instead of using scp you can also log in via ssh, open nano and copy and paste the script, save as tor-workstation.sh and exit)

Now you can log in from the host with (run on the host)

&lt;pre&gt;ssh -p 4444 user@127.0.0.1&lt;/pre&gt;
Before executing read through the script to check for errors (or malicious edits)!

&lt;pre&gt;nano tor-workstation.sh&lt;/pre&gt;
Make the script executable and run it (You need to run it directly on a terminal, not through ssh!) (run on the guest)

&lt;pre&gt;chmod +x tor-workstation.sh
sudo ./tor-workstation.sh&lt;/pre&gt;
== Final Steps ==

* remove port forwarding
* Poweroff. Set Adapter 1 to internal, rename the network to &quot;torbox&quot;

Skip the following if you build for your own use and not for redistribution. (run on the guest) * mv ./tor-workstation.sh /usr/share/doc/torbox #This script * set password to &quot;changeme&quot; if a different one was used before (use the command passwd) * rm .bash_history (you need to log out and back in first for this to have any effect) * Export the VM, save as Tor-Workstation.ova * [/TestAndTroubleshoot Test] the image before release!

This page documents how the [Download binary distribution images] are built. If you have any questions or need help let us know on [Dev#Questions /Whonix/Dev#Question].

The scripts used to build a certain version of a Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation image can be found in the VM at /usr/share/doc/torbox (in TorBox 0.2 at /usr/local/bin/tor-*) and through the wiki history.

Following these instructions will build version Whonix 0.2.1 based on Tor 0.2.3 and Ubuntu Precise.

Knowledge assumed: Virtualization and networking basic principles; operation of your platform; Linux knowledge: how to install Ubuntu and basic command line knowledge.

Only one prerequisites: you need a working internet connection.

For discussion related to the development and build process of Whonix images go [Dev/ Whonix/Dev/].

= Build Anonymity =

While downloading the required tools for building Whonix your internet service provider could if he want notice that you want to build Whonix. This is esspecially interesting, if you want to redistribute Whonix, but still want to stay anonymous. The full story can be read in the chapter [SecurityAndHardening#BuildAnonymity Build Anonymity].

= Build Security =

* Build on a dedicated build system, install security updates...
* All install media and all downloaded/used code must be verified (including all software on the host).
* Hashes or fingerprints listed on the wiki are not to be trusted, same goes for the scripts, verify them (and make use of the history feature).
* Read [Trust Whonix/Trust]

= Host preparation =

**Read and apply if necessary [Readme#NetworkTimeSyncing &quot;Network Time Syncing&quot;]!

We recommend you to use a dedicated OS installation just for hosting the Whonix VMs (See [SecurityAndHardening Whonix/SecurityAndHardening])

You need to use Ubuntu. The build scripts could be adapted to run on other*NIX systems as well but currently they assume apt-get to be available. You need about 15 GB of free space.

Install the latest security updates, install VirtualBox (and qemu-kvm which is required to mount the VirtualBox .vdi images). Reboot to apply kernel updates.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install virtualbox qemu genisoimage
sudo reboot&lt;/pre&gt;
If you are going to use VirtualBox inside VirtualBox, be sure to change your host key. VirtualBox -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Input -&gt; Host Key. The &quot;outside&quot; and the &quot;inside&quot; Host Key must differ, otherwise you can not leave the VM &quot;inside&quot; anymore. The &quot;outside&quot; VirtualBox hostkey may NOT be'''ctrl'''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ,, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Because the one is used by VBoxSDL &quot;inside&quot;.

Building on Windows is no longer supported. Redistributed Whonix builds should be build on Linux. If you want to port the Whonix build scripts to Windows, please contact us. Running Whonix on a Windows host with VirtualBox installed should still be possible.

== Using an apt cacher to speed up downloading ==

'''OPTIONAL'''

Does only work with Whonix-Gateway. ,, Does not work for Whonix-Workstation because it never gets direct access to the host by design. We could think about installing apt-cacher-ng on Whonix-Gateway, if there are any security implications.

Go to Whonix_Gateway script and comment in the line'''Acquire::http { Proxy &quot;http://192.168.0.2:3142&quot;; };''', i.e. remove the # (hash) in front of it.

If you want to build multiple times (for debugging etc.), it might make sense to install a local apt proxy on your build machine. That safes download time and traffic. ,,Thanks to [https://linuxexpresso.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/howto-apt-cacher-ng-on-ubuntu/ source].

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install apt-cacher-ng


sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf


Acquire::http { Proxy &quot;http://127.0.0.1:3142&quot;; };


sudo apt-get update&lt;/pre&gt;
= Source Code Intro =

'''If you prefer to read and understand the source code just by reading scripts you may skip this optional chapter.''' This chapter is dedicated to give an introduction into the Whonix source code. It can be quite difficult to get started with hacking existing big complex projects.

'''Whonix_Build''' is a script, which simply runs all other scripts. Actually it's &quot;optional&quot;. It has very little functionality besides running all other scripts. You are free to run all scripts one by one. That is useful for learning and for debugging purposes. In case you want to fix a bug or in case you want to upgrade the distribution or in case you want to switch the operating system or whatever you are better off running the steps manually. You can use the Build script as a reference for which steps have to be run in which order.

Ironically currently most scripts are used to create a virtual machine image, which contains the operating system and the either the Whonix_Gateway or the Whonix_Workstation script. Scripts needed for creation the virtual machine image are Whonix_GetISO, Whonix_ModifyISO, Whonix_CreateVM and Whonix_Image. GetISO downloads and verifies the operating system iso image.

ModifyISO mounts the downloaded iso image as read only, copies it, modifies the copied iso image by adding preseeding (unattended installation), unmounts the iso and finally creates preseed.iso, which contains the operating system installer disc modified not to require any user interaction while installing. This process already sets up lots of important privacy settings and other stuff, such as UTC timezone, hostname ubuntu, US language, username user and so on. (See [SecurityAndHardening Whonix/SecurityAndHardening] and the ModifyISO script itself for a list of all changes and why.) Preseed.iso is configured to power off itself when it's done installing so the Whonix_Build script can continue.

Whonix_CreateVM creates VirtualBox machines with all settings required for secure networking, devices, security settings. Which those settings are in details can be again read in Security And Hardening or the script itself. CreateVM is also responsible for starting virtual machines while building. That happens two times, the first time the operating system will be installed and the second time either the Whonix_Gateway or the Whonix_Workstation script will be installed.

Whonix_Image allow to mount the virtual hdd images. This is required because we have to somehow get the Whonix_Gateway or the Whonix_Workstation script into the virtual hdds, so we can install them. With Whonix 0.1.3 we used ssh, but that was suboptimal. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''Image''' also allows to copy the Whonix_Gateway or the Whonix_Workstation script to /usr/local/bin/ inside the virtual hdd images. It also adds autostarting them only once as soon as the virtual machine gets started next time. This is done by adding the script to /etc/rc.local. rc.local will look if the installer log exists and if that is so, the script will not be run again. rc.local will also power off the VM if the Whonix_Gateway or Whonix_Workstation script finished. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

,, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It required manually installing an ssh server just for getting the script into the virtual hdds. Ok, that could also be done with preseed. But it involves weakening the isolation of the VM from the host. The MAC address of the host could be seen my the VM. ,, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; /etc/rc.local will be reverted by the Whonix_Gateway or the Whonix_Workstation script.

Whonix_Gateway or the Whonix_Workstation will transform the installed operating system into the Whonix-Gateway or into the Whonix-Workstation. They update the system, install security relevant software, install useful applications for an anonymous general purpose operating system, set up all relevant privacy and anonymity required settings, desktop manager etc.

Thus, given the nature of the build step orientated scripts, you can easily work on the different aspects of Whonix. For example, once you have created a clean virtual machine with the operating system only, you can make a clone or snapshot, run either the Whonix_Gateway or the Whonix_Workstation script as often as you need to test your changes and if something goes wrong, go back to the clone or snapshot. You don't have to build everything from scratch again. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

,, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; For example, we could add the Whonix_Gateway or Whonix_Workstation script to the preseed.iso and let it run after installing. If something would go wrong, you would have to reinstall the whole operating system every time again. That's why we use separate steps.

The'''torcheck''' script will only be copied into Whonix-Workstation and is supposed to be run in Whonix-Workstation only. Checks network connection, Tor Browser version, SocksPort and TransPort IP and stream isolation.

= Get the Whonix source code =

Get all our scripts (currently 8) and save them in one folder, it's best to create a new folder called Whonix_src in your home directory. It is important that they are all named correctly!

Check the source code for error or malicious edits. Make use of the history feature of torproject.org's wiki.

= Create the Images =

== Preparations ==

Make the build script executable:

&lt;pre&gt;chmod +x ~/Whonix_source/Whonix_*&lt;/pre&gt;
Make sure there aren't any VMs in VirtualBox already called &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; or &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot; (TODO: automate that)

== VM Creation ==

,, -all not supported yet.

(1). Open a shell and type:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ~/Whonix_source/Whonix_Build -tg&lt;/pre&gt;
(2). Check if all went ok.

(3). Power on Whonix_Gateway

(4). Open a shell and type:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ~/Whonix_source/Whonix_Build -tw&lt;/pre&gt;
The scripts can fail for many reasons, please report back any issues!

= How to use the ova images =

Reboot both VMs. Please read the [Readme Readme]!

= Final Steps (Only Required For Redistribution) =

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[LeakTests Leak Testing]!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[TestAndTroubleshoot Test] the images before release! TODO: Needs big revision with all Whonix features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the [Changelog Changelog].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create hash sums for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sha512sum Whonix-Gateway.ova sha512sum Whonix-Workstation.ova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post hash sums to build documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post download links to build documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least a few testers should test before posting a news. Testers may be found by posting a news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally announce: Post a news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

This page documents how the binary distribution images are built. If you have any questions or need help let us know on [[Dev/Archived Discussions]].

Following these instructions will build version Whonix 0.3.0 based on Tor 0.2.3 and Ubuntu Precise.

Knowledge assumed: Virtualization and networking basic principles; operation of your platform; Linux knowledge: how to install Ubuntu and basic command line knowledge.

Only one prerequisites: you need a working internet connection.

For discussion related to the development and build process of Whonix images go [[Dev/Archived Discussions]].

= Build Anonymity =

While downloading the required tools for building Whonix your internet service provider could if he want notice that you want to build Whonix. This is esspecially interesting, if you want to redistribute Whonix, but still want to stay anonymous. The full story can be read in the chapter [[Build Anonymity]].

= Build Security =

* Build on a dedicated build system, install security updates...
* All install media and all downloaded/used code must be verified (including all software on the host).
* Hashes, fingerprints in the scripts and the wiki is not to be trusted. Verify everything.
* Read [[Trust]]

= Host preparation =

We recommend you to use a dedicated OS installation just for hosting the Whonix VMs. (See [[Security Guide]])

You need to use Ubuntu. The build scripts could be adapted to run on other *NIX systems as well but currently they assume apt-get to be available. You need about 15 GB of free space.

Install the latest security updates, install VirtualBox (and qemu-kvm which is required to mount the VirtualBox .vdi images). Reboot to apply kernel updates.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install virtualbox qemu genisoimage
sudo reboot&lt;/pre&gt;
If you are going to use VirtualBox inside VirtualBox, be sure to change your host key. VirtualBox -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Input -&gt; Host Key. The &quot;outside&quot; and the &quot;inside&quot; Host Key must differ, otherwise you can not leave the VM &quot;inside&quot; anymore. The &quot;outside&quot; VirtualBox hostkey may NOT be '''ctrl'''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

,, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Because the one is used by VBoxSDL &quot;inside&quot;.

Building on Windows is no longer supported. Redistributed Whonix builds should be build on Linux. If you want to port the Whonix build scripts to Windows, please contact us. Running Whonix on a Windows host with VirtualBox installed should is still possible.

== Using an apt cache to speed up downloading ==

'''OPTIONAL'''

Does only work with Whonix-Gateway. ,, Does not work for Whonix-Workstation because it never gets direct access to the host by design. We could think about installing apt-cacher-ng on Whonix-Gateway, if there are any security implications.

If you want to build multiple times (for debugging etc.), it might make sense to install a local apt proxy on your build machine. That safes download time and traffic.

,,Thanks to [https://linuxexpresso.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/howto-apt-cacher-ng-on-ubuntu/ source].

On the host:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install apt-cacher-ng&lt;/pre&gt;
.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf&lt;/pre&gt;
.

&lt;pre&gt;# /etc/apt/apt.conf
Acquire::http { Proxy &quot;http://127.0.0.1:3142&quot;; };&lt;/pre&gt;
.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/pre&gt;
In whonix_gateway source code: Go to /home/user/whonix/whonix_gateway/usr/local/bin/whonix_internal_install_script script and comment in the line ''Acquire::http { Proxy &quot;http://192.168.0.2:3142&quot;; };'', i.e. remove the # (hash) in front of it.

= Source Code Intro =

'''If you prefer to read and understand the source code just by reading scripts you may skip this optional chapter.''' This chapter is dedicated to give an introduction into the Whonix source code. It can be quite difficult to get started with hacking existing big complex projects.

Both Virtual Machines will be started two times while building Whonix. The first time the operating system will be installed and the second time either the whonix_internal_install_script runs.

'''whonix_gateway''' All files within that folder will be copied into Whonix-Gateway. '''whonix_workstation''' All files within that folder will be copied into Whonix-Workstation. '''whonix_shared''' All files within that folder will be copied into Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. Copying is done with whonix_craetevm and implemented in int_copy_gateway, int_copy_workstation and int_copy_shared.

'''int_xxx''' scripts are internally used by whonix_xxx scripts.

'''whonix_build''' is a script, which simply runs all other scripts. Actually it's &quot;optional&quot;. It has very little functionality besides running all other scripts. You are free to run all scripts one by one. That is useful for learning and for debugging purposes. In case you want to fix a bug or in case you want to upgrade the distribution or in case you want to switch the operating system or whatever you are better off running the steps manually. You can use the Build script as a reference for which steps have to be run in which order.

'''whonix_getiso''' downloads and verifies the operating system iso image.

'''whonix_modifyiso''' mounts the downloaded iso image as read only, copies it, modifies the copied iso image by adding preseeding (unattended installation), unmounts the iso and finally creates preseed.iso, which contains the operating system installer disc modified not to require any user interaction while installing. This process already sets up lots of important privacy settings and other stuff, such as UTC timezone, hostname ubuntu, US language, username user and so on. (See Security and the modifyiso script itself for a list of all changes and why.) Preseed.iso is configured to power off itself when it's done installing so the whonix_build script can continue.

'''whonix_createvm''' creates VirtualBox machines with all settings required for secure networking, devices, security settings. Which those settings are in details can be again read in Security And Hardening or the script itself. whonix_createvm is also responsible for starting virtual machines while building. It also features to mount the virtual hdd images for debugging reasons. The whonix_internal_install_script will be copied into the VMs by whonix_createvm.

'''whonix_internal_install_script''' A Whonix-Gateway specific version is stored under /home/user/whonix/whonix_gateway/usr/local/bin/whonix_internal_install_script and a Whonix-Workstation specific version is stored under /home/user/whonix/whonix_gateway/usr/local/bin/whonix_internal_install_script. This script gets copied into the Virtual Machines by whonix_createvm. whonix_internal_install_script gets automatically started, only once at build time, by rc.local. They will transform the installed operating system into the Whonix-Gateway or into the Whonix-Workstation. They update the system, install security relevant software, install useful applications for an anonymous general purpose operating system, set up all relevant privacy and anonymity required settings, desktop manager etc.

'''rc.local''' (/home/user/whonix/rc.local) gets copied to into the VMs to /etc/rc.local and keeps care of automatically starting whonix_internal_install_script. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The final version of rc.local, which the user will see, will be reverted by 'whonix_createvm -tX-copyinto-post' and can be found under /home/user/whonix/whonix_shared/etc/rc.local.

Thus, given the nature of the build step orientated scripts, you can easily work on the different aspects of Whonix. For example, once you have created a clean virtual machine with the operating system only, you can make a clone or snapshot, run either the whonix_Gateway or the whonix_Workstation script as often as you need to test your changes and if something goes wrong, go back to the clone or snapshot. You don't have to build everything from scratch again. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

,, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; For example, we could add the whonix_Gateway or whonix_Workstation script to the preseed.iso and let it run after installing. If something would go wrong, you would have to reinstall the whole operating system every time again. That's why we use separate steps.

= Get the Whonix source code =

&lt;pre&gt;git clone https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix&lt;/pre&gt;
= Create the Images =

== Preparations ==

&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make the build script executable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chmod +x ~/whonix/whonix_*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure there aren't any VMs in VirtualBox already called &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; or &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot; (TODO: automate that)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check if /home/user/whonix/usr/share/version for version number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

== VM Creation ==

,, -all not supported yet.

&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open a shell and type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo ~/whonix/whonix_build -tg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check if all went ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power on whonix_Gateway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open a shell and type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo ~/whonix/whonix_build -tw&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The scripts can fail for many reasons, please report back any issues!

= Debugging =

'''OPTIONAL''' (Only in case something goes wrong or you want to audit or develop Whonix.)

== SSH into Whonix-Gateway ==

On Whonix-Gateway: Open /usr/local/bin/whonix_firewall

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /usr/local/bin/whonix_firewall&lt;/pre&gt;
Comment in the incoming SSH connection firewall rule.

&lt;pre&gt;iptables -A INPUT -i &quot;$EXT_IF&quot; -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT&lt;/pre&gt;
Restart firewall.

&lt;pre&gt;/usr/local/bin/whonix_firewall&lt;/pre&gt;
Inside Whonix-Workstation:

&lt;pre&gt;# Run once.
sudo apt-get install opensshd-server&lt;/pre&gt;
On the host: Add port forwarding from host into Virtual Machine.

&lt;pre&gt;# Run once.
VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; --natpf1 &quot;ssh&quot;,tcp,127.0.0.1,2222,,22&lt;/pre&gt;
On the host: Open a ssh session.

&lt;pre&gt;ssh user@127.0.0.1 -p 2222

# Requires setting a root password beforehand.
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222&lt;/pre&gt;
On the host: Or mount Whonix-Gateway as a folder.

&lt;pre&gt;sshfs user@127.0.0.1:/ -p 2222 /home/user/whonix_binary/whonix-Gateway_sshfs

# Requires setting a root password beforehand.
sshfs root@127.0.0.1:/ -p 2222 /home/user/whonix_binary/whonix-Gateway_sshfs&lt;/pre&gt;
== Mount and inspect images and Whonixinstalllogs ==

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ./whonix_createvm -tg-mount

cd &quot;/home/user/whonix_binary/whonix-Gateway_image&quot;
kwrite &quot;/home/user/whonix_binary/whonix-Gateway_image/home/user/whonixinstalllog&quot;
cd ~

sudo ./whonix_createvm -tg-unmount&lt;/pre&gt;
.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ./whonix_createvm -tw-mount

cd &quot;/home/user/whonix_binary/whonix-Workstation_image&quot;
kwrite &quot;/home/user/whonix_binary/whonix-Workstation_image/home/user/whonixinstalllog&quot;
cd ~

sudo ./whonix_createvm -tw-unmount&lt;/pre&gt;
= How to use the ova images =

Reboot both VMs. Please read the Readme!

= Final Steps (Only Required For Redistribution) =

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[LeakTests]]!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Test]] the images before release! TODO: Needs big revision with all Whonix features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the [[Dev/Changelog]].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create hash sums for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sha512sum Whonix-Gateway.ova sha512sum Whonix-Workstation.ova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post hash sums to build documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post download links to build documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least a few testers should test before posting a news. Testers may be found by posting a news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally announce: Post a news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

= Changelog Whonix 0.3.0 =

'''UNFINISHED'''

* Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation
** Added Secure Distributed Network Time Synchronization. Thanks to the Tails developers for their fine, free and Open Source tails_htp!
** Added timesync gui.
** Deactivated VirtualBox time synchronization.
** Deactivating VirtualBox guest additions time synchronization if they are installed.

** Now using stream isolation and uwt.
* Whonix-Workstation
** Running every day Whonixcheck cron job hopefully fixes.
** Partially fixed gnome-terminal black on black bug. Uses ugly colors and users are hopefully motivated to change the colors.
** new commands:
*** xchat-reset (Deletes XChat configuration files and recreates the Whonix original ones, which are tweaked for privacy.)
*** hiddenserver-install (Installs and configures lighttpd)
* Source Code
** Now hosted on github, https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/ and therefore safe against malicious edits by random people.
** All files are now inside their own files and no longer in single big scripts.
** Deprecated onevm (no maintainer).
** Deprecated uninstall and uninstall-vm (would require rewrite, was less tested, no users, we don't install the operating system manually anymore).
** Error handling for everything.
** Uwt wrappers share now most code.
** Many fixes, more robustness, step based build system.

This page documents how the binary distribution images are built. If you have any questions or need help let us know on [[Dev/Archived Discussions]].

Following these instructions will build version Whonix 0.4.5.1 based on Tor 0.2.3 and Debian Wheezy.

Knowledge assumed: Virtualization and networking basic principles; operation of your platform; Linux knowledge: how to install Debian and basic command line knowledge.

Only one prerequisites: you need a working internet connection.

For discussion related to the development and build process of Whonix images go [[Dev/Archived Discussions]].

= Build Anonymity =

While downloading the required tools for building Whonix your internet service provider could if he want notice that you want to build Whonix. This is especially interesting, if you want to redistribute Whonix, but still want to stay anonymous. The full story can be read in the chapter [[Build Anonymity]].

= Build Security =

* Build on a dedicated build system, install security updates...
* All install media and all downloaded/used code must be verified (including all software on the host).
* Hashes, fingerprints in the scripts and the wiki is not to be trusted. Verify everything.
* Read [[Trust]]

= Host preparation =

== Building on Linux ==

We recommend you to use a dedicated OS installation just for hosting the Whonix VMs. (See [[Security Guide]])

You need to use Debian. The build scripts could be adapted to run on other *NIX systems as well but currently they assume apt-get to be available. You need about 15 GB of free space.

Install the latest security updates, install VirtualBox (and qemu-kvm which is required to mount the VirtualBox .vdi images). Reboot to apply kernel updates.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install virtualbox qemu genisoimage apt-cacher-ng grml-debootstrap parted kpartx debootstrap mksh dialog git
sudo reboot&lt;/pre&gt;
== Building on Windows ==

Building on Windows is no longer supported. Redistributed Whonix builds should be build on Linux. If you want to port the Whonix build scripts to Windows, please contact us. Running Whonix on a Windows host with VirtualBox installed should is still possible.

== Using an apt cache to speed up downloading ==

If you want to build multiple times (for debugging etc.), it makes sense to install a local apt proxy on your build machine.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; That safes download time and traffic.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; If you build Whonix on Whonix, apt-cacher-ng will go through Tor's TransPort.

 ,, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Thanks to [https://linuxexpresso.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/howto-apt-cacher-ng-on-ubuntu/ source]. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; It would be possible to download without an apt-cacher. But why? If you want so ignore this chapter and change the mirror settings in grml configuration file. 

Open /etc/apt/apt.conf.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf&lt;/pre&gt;
Add the following.

&lt;pre&gt;# /etc/apt/apt.conf
Acquire::http { Proxy &quot;http://127.0.0.1:3142&quot;; };&lt;/pre&gt;
Restart apt-cacher-ng. Should not be required, but it was for me.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service apt-cacher-ng restart&lt;/pre&gt;
Safe and test if it's working.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo /usr/bin/apt-get update&lt;/pre&gt;
= Source Code Intro =

This chapter is dedicated to give an introduction into the Whonix source code. '''If you prefer to read and understand the source code just by reading scripts you may skip this optional chapter.'''

Moved to [[Dev/Source Code Intro]].

= Build as user &quot;user&quot; =

You need a user account named &quot;''user''&quot;. If you don't already have it, create it.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo adduser user&lt;/pre&gt;
During the build process &quot;''user''&quot; also needs root.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo addgroup user sudo&lt;/pre&gt;
Log in as &quot;''user''&quot;.

 This is because the source code is far from perfect. The username &quot;user&quot; and /home/user/Whonix is hardcoded and expected as source folder. Bug: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/Dev#SOURCECODEnolongerhardcodeuserfolder no longer hardcode user folder] 

= Get the Whonix source code =

&lt;pre&gt;git clone https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix&lt;/pre&gt;
= Verify the Whonix source code with gpg =

This is recommended but not required. See [[Trust]].

# [[Whonix Signing Key|Learn about Whonix signing key]].

(1.1) Get into the correct [[Dev/git|git branch]].

&lt;pre&gt;##Not required. Still using the master branch.
##Next Whonix version will reflect the new branching model.
#git checkout stable&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a list of available git tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git tag&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verify the tag you want to build.&lt;/p&gt;
= Replace with tag you want to build. =

&lt;p&gt;git tag -v 0.4.5.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output should look like the following.&lt;/p&gt;

= Introduction =

'''This page reflects 0.5.6, the released and stable Whonix version! If you want to develop Whonix, rather get the latest, because the source code layout was heavily simplified.'''

This page documents how the binary distribution images are built. If you have any questions or need help let us know on [[Dev/Archived Discussions]].

Following these instructions will build version Whonix 0.5.x based on Tor and Debian Wheezy.

Knowledge assumed: Virtualization and networking basic principles; operation of your platform; Linux knowledge: how to install Debian and basic command line knowledge.

Only one prerequisites: you need a working internet connection.

For discussion related to the development and build process of Whonix images go [[Dev/Archived Discussions]].

= Warning =

''/dev/mapper/loop0p1'' (and ''/dev/nbd0'') (used for mounting the images) is hard coded inside Whonix build scripts. Beware if you are using such devices. It may conflict with TrueCrypt. (And possibly other tools relying on ''/dev/mapper/loop0p1'' (and ''/dev/nbd0'').)

To avoid damage to your host system, it may be wise to build Whonix inside a Virtual Machine.

= Dev/Build Anonymity =

While downloading the required tools for building Whonix your internet service provider could if he want notice that you want to build Whonix. This is especially interesting, if you want to redistribute Whonix, but still want to stay anonymous. The full story can be read in the chapter [[Dev/Build Anonymity]].

= Build Security =

Especially, but not exclusively, if you want to distribute Whonix images, you should improve the security of your build environment.

* Build on a dedicated build system, install security updates... ([[Security Guide]])
* All install media and all downloaded/used code must be verified (including all software on the host).
* Hashes, fingerprints in the scripts and the wiki is not to be trusted. Verify everything.
* Read [[Trust]].

= Host preparation =

== Building on Linux ==

It is recommended to set your terminal (for example Konsole) to unlimited scrollback, so you can watch the full creation log.

You need to use '''Debian'''. (How to obtain Debian safely: [[Debian|Debian ISO gpg verification]])

The build scripts could be adapted to run on other *NIX systems as well but currently they assume apt-get and grml-debootstrap to be available. You need about 15 GB of free space.

Become root.

&lt;pre&gt;su&lt;/pre&gt;
Update package lists and upgrade.

&lt;pre&gt;apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/pre&gt;
Install build dependencies.

&lt;pre&gt;apt-get install virtualbox qemu apt-cacher-ng grml-debootstrap parted kpartx debootstrap mksh dialog git sudo equivs rsync&lt;/pre&gt;
Add user to sudo group.

&lt;pre&gt;addgroup user sudo&lt;/pre&gt;
Reboot.

&lt;pre&gt;reboot&lt;/pre&gt;
== Building on Windows ==

Building Whonix directly on Windows is no longer supported. Redistributed Whonix builds should be build on Linux. If you want to port the Whonix build scripts to Windows, please [[Contact]] us. Running Whonix on a Windows host with VirtualBox installed and building Whonix inside a Virtual Machine with a Linux guest on a Windows host is still possible.

== Using an apt cache to speed up downloading ==

If you want to build multiple times (for debugging etc.), it makes sense to install a local apt proxy on your build machine. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; That safes download time and traffic. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; If you build Whonix on Whonix, apt-cacher-ng will go through Tor's TransPort.

 ,, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Thanks to [https://linuxexpresso.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/howto-apt-cacher-ng-on-ubuntu/ source]. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; It would be possible to download without an apt-cacher. But why? If you want to ignore it, ignore this chapter and change the mirror settings in grml configuration file. 

If you build inside Whonix-Workstation, disable the apt-get uwt wrapper.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo chmod -x /usr/local/bin/apt-get&lt;/pre&gt;
Open ''/etc/apt/apt.conf''.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf&lt;/pre&gt;
Add the following.

&lt;pre&gt;## /etc/apt/apt.conf
Acquire::http { Proxy &quot;http://127.0.0.1:3142&quot;; };&lt;/pre&gt;
Restart apt-cacher-ng. Should not be required, but it was for me.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service apt-cacher-ng restart&lt;/pre&gt;
Safe and test if it's working.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/pre&gt;
Should there ever be a problem with apt-cacher-ng (package verification failure) (rare cases), use this.

&lt;pre&gt;#sudo apt-get update
#sudo apt-get autoremove
#sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
#sudo apt-get clean
#sudo apt-get autoclean&lt;/pre&gt;
= Source Code Intro =

== Introduction ==

This chapter is dedicated to give an introduction into the Whonix source code. '''If you prefer to read and understand the source code just by reading scripts you may skip this optional chapter.''' When you like to mess with the source code, it would probably help a lot if you at least knew what '''.img''', '''.vdi''', '''.vmdk''' and '''.ova''' are being used for.

Moved to [[Dev/Source Code Intro]].

= Build as user &quot;user&quot; =

Log in as &quot;''user''&quot;.

 This is because the build script is far from perfect. The username &quot;''user''&quot; and ''/home/user/Whonix'' is hardcoded and expected as source folder. Bug: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/Dev#SOURCECODEnolongerhardcodeuserfolder no longer hardcode user folder] 

== gpg keys ==

gpg keys for required for build Whonix are stored inside ''/home/user/Whonix/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/''. These include.

* adrelanos.asc - Whonix maintainer key - used for [[whonixcheck]] news verification
* erinn.asc - [https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en obtained from torproject.org] - Used to verify downloads of Tor Browser by ''whonix_workstation/usr/local/bin/torbrowser''.
* sebastian.asc - same as erinn.asc.

To find out what the keys are good for, simply grep the source code.

&lt;pre&gt;cd /home/user/Whonix
grep -r adrelanos.asc *
grep -r erinn.asc *
grep -r sebastian.asc *&lt;/pre&gt;
If you are in luck, you never have to update the keys yourself and the Whonix maintainer will keep it updated. Otherwise and also as a good precaution you can verify these keys manually. Follow the instructions from torproject.org to obtain the key. Then simply check if the keys match or update the old key with the new one.

== Rebuilding Debian packages ==

Should not be necessary. The package is already ready.

Currently only the [[Dev/Dummy Tor|Dummy Tor]] package. Documenting for the sake of completeness.

&lt;pre&gt;cd /home/user/Whonix/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/
rm tor_1.0_all.deb
./dummytor
cd /home/user/Whonix/&lt;/pre&gt;
= Get the Whonix source code =

&lt;pre&gt;git clone https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix&lt;/pre&gt;
= Verify the Whonix source code with gpg =

This is recommended but not required. See [[Trust]].

&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[[Whonix Signing Key|Learn about Whonix signing key]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a list of available git tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git tag&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verify the tag you want to build.&lt;/p&gt;
== Replace with tag you want to build. ==

&lt;p&gt;git tag -v 0.5.6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output should look like the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;object 13870efc29018065267788f9f23026e6ff489684 type commit tag 0.5.6 tagger adrelanos &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt; 1348681401 -0400&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.5.6 gpg: Signature made Wed Sep 26 17:43:26 2012 UTC using RSA key ID 713AAEEF gpg: Good signature from &quot;adrelanos &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The warning.

&lt;pre&gt;gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.&lt;/pre&gt;
(1.1) Get into the correct [[Dev/git|git branch]].

&lt;pre&gt;## 0.5.6
git checkout 0.5.6

## For stable hotfixes.
#git checkout stable

## In case you want to use the development branch.
#git checkout devel

## In case you want to use the bleeding edge and help with development.
#git checkout untested_adre&lt;/pre&gt;
Is explained on the [[Whonix Signing Key]] page and can be ignored.

= Create the Images =

== Preparations ==

&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Git checkout, which version you want to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git checkout 0.5.6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure there aren't any VMs in VirtualBox already called &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; or &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot; (TODO: automate that)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check if /home/user/Whonix/usr/share/version for version number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

== VM Creation ==

&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open a shell and type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build -all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check if all went ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The scripts can fail for many reasons, please report back any issues!

= Debugging =

'''OPTIONAL''' (Only in case something goes wrong or you want to audit or develop Whonix.)

* [[File Transfer#SSH into Whonix-Gateway|SSH into Whonix-Gateway]]
* [[File Transfer#Mount and inspect images|Mount and inspect images]]
* Rebuild the .ova images, while skipping the -tX-createimg step.

The &quot;''sudo ./whonix_createvm -tX-createimg''&quot; step takes far most of the build creation time. As long as no packages have been added or removed, you can repeat all other steps from a backup, which has been automatically created for you, by using.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ./whonix_build -fast&lt;/pre&gt;
* Interactively chroot Whonix-Gateway.

Open a bash shell inside the Whonix-Gateway '''.img''' image.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ./whonix_createvm -tg-interactive&lt;/pre&gt;
* Interactively chroot Whonix-Workstation.

Open a bash shell inside the Whonix-Workstation '''.img''' image.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ./whonix_createvm -tw-interactive&lt;/pre&gt;
= How to use the ova images =

Reboot both VMs. Please read the [[Documentation]]!

= Final Steps (Only Required For Redistribution) =

== apt.conf ==

What is ''/usr/local/share/whonix/apt.conf'' good for?

This apt.conf is only used inside chroot and currently only in effect for &quot;''./whonix_createvm -tg-source''&quot; and &quot;''./whonix_createvm -tg-source''&quot;.

It points to ''http://192.168.0.2:3142'', which is expected to be a Whonix-Workstation with apt-cacher-ng running. It's useful for running &quot;''apt-get install''&quot; and &quot;''apt-get source''&quot; inside chroot, because downloads are cached, which speeds up the build process when building several times in a row. (Debugging with only minor changes.)

In case you don't want to use it or to use another proxy, edit ''/home/user/Whonix/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/apt.conf'' (comment out with a # or change proxy settings). Don't forget ./whonix_createvm -tX-copyinto-pre after modifying the file.

== other ==

* Don't forget to update Whonix version number.
* [[LeakTests]]!
* [[Test]] the images before release! TODO: Needs big revision with all Whonix features.
* See if [[Documentation]] still makes sense.
* Update the [[Changelog]].
* See https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/whonix_release

|description=Introduction into Whonix's source code.
}}
{{forkme}}
= Introduction =
This chapter is dedicated to give an introduction into the Whonix source code. '''''If you prefer to read and understand the source code just by reading scripts you may skip this optional chapter.''''' It can be quite difficult to get started with hacking existing big complex projects.

'''''Files and folders overview''''':

* '''whonix_gateway''' All files within that folder will be copied into Whonix-Gateway.
* '''whonix_workstation''' All files within that folder will be copied into Whonix-Workstation.
* '''whonix_shared''' All files within that folder will be copied into Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

'''Chroot Scripts'''

* /whonix_gateway/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d are run inside Whonix-Gateway
* /whonix_workstation/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d are run inside Whonix-Workstation
* /whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d are run inside Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation
* There are also chroot-scripts-post.d folders.

'''build-steps'''

This is a high level overview. Whonix-Example-Implementation can currently be build in nine steps. (There is also a whonix_build script, which automates these eight steps for your convenience.)

* 1100_prepare-build-machine
* 1200_create-debian-packages
* 1300_create-debian-img
* 1400_backup-img-after-grml-debootstrap
* 1700_install-meta-packages
* 1800_backup-img-after-meta-package-install
* 1900_run-chroot-scripts-pre-d
* 2000_install-files-packages
* 2100_verify-files
* 2200_install-postinst-d-packages
* 2300_run-chroot-scripts-post-d
* 2400_convert-img-to-vdi
* 2500_create-vbox-vm
* 2600_export-vbox-vm

'''debug-steps'''

Some stuff to help developers with testing and debugging.

* delete-vbox-vm
* download-source
* interactive-img

'''help-steps'''

Boring methods, which are required by the build-steps above.

* mount-img
* mount-vdi
* chroot-img
* unchroot-img
* unmount-img
* unmount-img-force
* unmount-vdi
* unmount-vdi-force
* pre gets sourced by all other scripts.
* variables gets sourced by all other scripts.

'''whonix_build'''

Is a script, which simply runs all other build-steps. Actually it's &quot;optional&quot;. It has very little functionality besides running all other steps. You are free to run all steps one by one. That is useful for learning and for debugging purposes. In case you want to fix a bug or in case you want to upgrade the distribution or in case you want to switch the operating system or whatever you are better off running the steps manually. Run it with -help to see available switches. It has also has a --fast1 and --fast2 switch which skips certain steps, which is useful for debugging purposes if these steps were already run.

'''''Overview''''':

# prepare-build-machine: installs build dependencies and applies a few other required settings for building from source.
# create-debian-packages
# create-debian-img: [http://grml.org/grml-debootstrap/ grml-debootstrap] creates virtual machine images in '''.img''' image format. It keeps care of creating the image, the partition table, grub boot manager, minimal system debootstrap and apt-get installing all Whonix packages. This step requires most time in the build process.
# backup-img-after-grml-debootstrap: A backup _copy of the '''.img''' gets created.
# install-meta-packages: Installs meta .deb packages whonix-shared-packages-dependencies/recommended, desktop, desktop-kde, kde-accessibility and whonix-*-packages-dependencies/recommended and whonix-workstation-default-applications. Those only include dependencies and recommended packages which are pulled from Debian's apt repository.
# backup-img-after-meta-package-install
# run-chroot-scripts-pre-d: Pre Chroot Scripts are applied.
# install-files-packages: Installs .deb packages whonix-shared-files whonix-gateway/workstation-files.
# verify-files: Checks if configuration/script files from Whonix source code match those actually installed inside the .img.
# install-postinst-d-packages: Postinstall scripts are applied.
# run-chroot-scripts-post-d: Post Chroot Scripts are applied.
# convert-img-to-vdi: The '''.img''' image gets converted to a '''.vdi''' image. Actually not converted, a new file will be created and the old '''.img''' remains available until cleanup is run or manually deleted or grml-debootstrap runs again. The '''.img''' format is more &quot;generic&quot;. VirtualBox does not support raw ('''.img''') images, but '''.vdi''' and '''.vmdk''' (and others).
# create-vbox-vm: A virtual machine (VirtualBox) will be created and the '''.vdi''' image will be attached.
# export-vbox-vm: The virtual machines get exported to a '''.ova''' images. (Technically the '''.ova''' format seams to require '''.vmdk''' files. Therefore VirtualBox automatically creates it. So anyone using or extracting the '''.ova''' image will see that it includes a '''.vmdk''' image.)

'''''Modularity:'''''

All steps could be easily replaced to add support for additional virtualizers, operating systems and so on. The numbers before the script names (20_..., 25_..., 30..., ...) are honored by whonix_build (using [http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man8/run-parts.8.html run-parts]), which runs these steps in lexical order. Therefore you can easily add steps to the beginning or the end or even wretch steps in between.

'''''File sizes:'''''

Do not get shocked by file sized. Initially the .img is created with a size of 100 GB, but it will actually only take a fraction of that space on the harddrive. This is because .img .vdi and .vmdk are all sparse files, which means they do not take their maximum size, but only as much data as really is inside these images.

'''''Summary:'''''

Thus, given the nature of the build step orientated scripts, you can easily work on the different aspects of Whonix. For example, once you have created a clean virtual machine with the operating system only, you can make a copy, run either the gateway or the workstation copy routine or Chroot Scripts as often as you need to test your changes and if something goes wrong, go back to backup. You don't have to build everything from scratch again. &lt;ref&gt;If something would go wrong, you would have to reinstall the whole operating system every time again. That's why we use separate steps.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Another Introduction:'''''

It's really not that difficult after all. If you like, you could read [[Manually Creating Whonix]], which is a similar topic, which covers part of this in other words.

= OpenPGP keys =
OpenPGP public keys required for building Whonix are stored inside ''/home/user/whonix_dot/Whonix/whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/keys/''. These include.

* tbb-keys.d
** erinn.asc - [https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en obtained from torproject.org] - Used to verify downloads of Tor Browser by ''whonix_workstation/usr/bin/torbrowser''.
** sebastian.asc - same as erinn.asc.
* tpoarchive-keys.d
** torprojectarchive.asc - Torproject's archive key https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en
* whonix-keys-revoked.d
** None yet.
* whonix-keys.d
** adrelanos.asc - Whonix maintainer key - used for [whonixcheck] news verification

To find out what the keys are good for, simply grep the source code.

&lt;pre&gt;
cd /home/user/Whonix
grep -r tbb-keys.d *
grep -r tpoarchive-keys.d *
grep -r whonix-keys-revoked *
grep -r whonix-keys.d *
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are in luck, you never have to update the keys yourself and the Whonix maintainer will keep them updated. Otherwise and also as a good precaution you can verify these keys manually. Follow the instructions from torproject.org to obtain the key. Then simply check if the keys match or update the old key with the new one.

Torproject's archive key expires on '''2014-08-29'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --fingerprint A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89
pub   2048R/886DDD89 2009-09-04 [expires: 2016-08-28]
      Key fingerprint = A3C4 F0F9 79CA A22C DBA8  F512 EE8C BC9E 886D DD89
uid                  deb.torproject.org archive signing key
sub   2048R/219EC810 2009-09-04 [expires: 2014-08-29]
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Debugging =

Stuff you may find helpful for debugging.

== Build Configuration ==
=== Build Configuration Folder ===
'''Whonix 7.3.2 and above!'''

You can drop configuration file either in:
# {{Code|buildconfig.d}} or in
# {{Code|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}}
# {{Code|../buildconfig.d}} folder.

Method 2. is recommended for users.

# Contains examples. It's more difficult to use, since you would have to git commit your build config files. Rather use.
# {{Code|sudo mkdir --parents /etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}}
# When {{Code|/home/user/Whonix}} is your Whonix source folder, you could use {{Code|/home/user/buildconfig.d}} as your Whonix build configuration folder. It's easier to use, since you don't have to git commit your build config files.

&lt;ref&gt;This is because {{Code|..}} means &quot;one level below this folder&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skipping Build Steps ===
Rebuild the .ova images, while skipping the slow ''prepare-build-machine'' and ''create-debian-img'' steps. (Of course, this assumes that these steps where run at least once previously.)

The {{Code|sudo ./build-steps/1300_create-debian-img -tX}} &lt;ref&gt;(replace X with g or w)&lt;/ref&gt; step takes far most of the build creation time. As long as no packages have been added or removed, you can repeat all other steps from a backup, which has been automatically created for you, by using.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --tor-gateway --build --fast1

## or --tor-workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

There is also {{Code|--fast2}}, which skips all steps up to and including 1700_install-meta-packages.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --tor-gateway --build --fast2
## or --tor-workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Skipping Chroot and Postinst Scripts ===
Some chroot scripts, especially the 70_update_command_not_found and 70_torbrowser take very long, while they are non-critical. You can either run update-command-not-found and the Tor Browser Updater after Whonix has been build and booted, or if you don't wish to use them at all, just don't use it at all. Therefore you can conveniently disable them, to safe some time, which is useful for debug builds.

Create your own build configuration, see {{Code|buildconfig.d}} folder. For see example {{Code|buildconfig.d/30_skip_torbrowser}}, which contains

&lt;pre&gt;
#export WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS+=&quot; 70_torbrowser &quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You could create a folder file {{Code|../buildconfig.d}} and a file {{Code|../buildconfig.d/50_skip_torbrowser}} and add.

&lt;pre&gt;
export WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS+=&quot; 70_torbrowser &quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This works for the following folders.

* whonix_*/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d
* whonix_*/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d
* whonix_*/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-post.d

Look at the file names and add them. ''export WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS+=&quot; another_file_name &quot;''. Don't forget empty spaces ({{Code| }}) before and after {{Code|&quot;}}. &lt;ref name=bash-array&gt;We are expanding a bash array.&lt;/ref&gt;

= SSH =

* [[File_Transfer#SSH_into_Whonix-Gateway|SSH into Whonix-Gateway]]
* [[File_Transfer#SSH_into_Whonix-Workstation|SSH into Whonix-Workstation]]

= Mount and inspect images =

[[File Transfer#mount-and-inspect-images|Mount and inspect images]]

== Interactive Chroot ==

* Interactively chroot Whonix-Gateway.

Open a bash shell inside the Whonix-Gateway '''.img''' image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./debug-steps/interactive-chroot-img -tg
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Interactively chroot Whonix-Workstation.

Open a bash shell inside the Whonix-Workstation '''.img''' image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./debug-steps/interactive-chroot-img -tw
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Check Whonix version number.

Important before building builds for redistribution.

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /home/user/Whonix/whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/version
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Less Important Goodies =

== Unpacking '''.ova''' images ==

If you want for some reason to unpack an '''.ova''', for example to get the '''.vdmk''' image, you can use tar.

&lt;pre&gt;
tar -xvf Whonix-Gateway.ova
Whonix-Gateway.ovf
Whonix-Gateway-disk1.vmdk
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Converting '''.vmdk''' images to '''.img''' images ==

&lt;pre&gt;
#qemu-img info Whonix-Gateway-disk1.vmdk

qemu-img convert Whonix-Gateway-disk1.vmdk -O raw Whonix-Gateway.img

#qemu-img info Whonix-Gateway.img
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Porting =

These are some random notes about porting Whonix update debs to rpm.

What would have to be done:

* create rpm package
* Find a replacement for config-package-dev, a package which allows third party packages (Whonix) to own files which are owned by other packages. Such as {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} is owned by tor, but whonix-shared-files includes its own config file.
* add init scripts (currently done by debhelper)
* add man pages (currently done by debhelper and ronn, see debian/rules)
* minor: replacement for dh_apparmor

|description=Copying files into and out of Whonix Virtual Machines.
}}
= Security Overview =

All methods:

* Risk of transferring [[Metadata]] or other sensitive information into Whonix-Workstation.
* Whonix is about isolation. If you import data from the host or other media into Whonix-Workstation you weaken isolation and must be very careful.

Shared Folder:

* Using filesharing built into VirtualBox (Shared Folder) isn't very secure.
* It requires installing [[VirtualBox Guest Additions]] and therefore weakens security.

SSH:

* Works with ssh, scp, sshfs. Instructions below.

ISO Images, Host -&gt; Whonix-Gateway/Workstation:

* Safest method of getting files into Whonix-Workstation.

USB devices plugged into VirtualBox:

* Hardware serials of the USB controller and/or USB device could leak into Whonix-Workstation.
* Requires closed source VirtualBox extensions.

Mounting Virtual Machine images:

* No idea if and if yes, what could leak into the Virtual Machine image.
* See also [[Dev/Build Anonymity]].

= Transfer files from the Host into Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation through ISO images =

On the host...

Install genisoimage:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install genisoimage&lt;/pre&gt;

To create an iso &quot;files.iso&quot; containing the content of &quot;folder&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;genisoimage -o files.iso /path/to/folder&lt;/pre&gt;

Use the VirtualBox graphical user interface to mount your newly created iso a virtual VM CD/DVD drive.

Inside Whonix-Workstation...

Create the folder /media/cdrom.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo mkdir -p /media/cdrom&lt;/pre&gt;

Now attach the iso to the VM. Mount it with

&lt;pre&gt;sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom&lt;/pre&gt;

Get into that folder.

&lt;pre&gt;cd /media/cdrom&lt;/pre&gt;

See your files.

&lt;pre&gt;dir&lt;/pre&gt;

This is intentionally one-way as the Whonix-Workstation is inherently untrusted and should remain isolated to prevent side-channel attacks and covert channel leaks.

= Transfer files from the Whonix Workstation into a different Whonix-Workstation through a VDI file =
This is one of the more convenient solutions for copying work from a Whonix 7 Workstation to a Whonix 8 Workstation. 

0. The virtual machine you want to edit needs to be powered off.

1. First, in VirtualBox, click on the &quot;Settings&quot; for the Whonix Workstation that you desire to copy files from. Then, click on &quot;Storage.&quot;

2. In the &quot;Storage&quot; settings, click on the square with a + sign on it to &quot;add hard disk.&quot; It will be located next to an entry that says &quot;Controller: Whonix.&quot;

3. In the next window that appears, click on &quot;create new disk.&quot;

4. When prompted to choose a &quot;hard drive file type,&quot;  select &quot;VDI.&quot;

5. When prompted to choose &quot;storage on physical hard drive,&quot; choose &quot;dynamically allocated.&quot;

6. In the next window, type &quot;WhonixTransferBackup&quot; for the drive name and then choose the storage capacity you need. In many cases, the default &quot;8.00 GB&quot; will be enough.

7. When you are returned to the &quot;Settings&quot; window, click the &quot;OK&quot; button.

8. Next, start the Whonix Workstation that you wish to transfer files from. When you reach the desktop, open a Terminal/Konsole session. 

9. Now, format the new drive you created. Type
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
&lt;/pre&gt;
at the command prompt that appears, type &quot;n&quot; create a new partition. Press &quot;enter&quot; to choose the default options when prompted until you are returned to fdisk's main menu. Finally, when you are returned to fdisk's main command prompt, type &quot;w&quot; to write the partition and exit fdisk.

10. Next, type
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
&lt;/pre&gt;
in the terminal session. 

11. Now create a new directory to be the mount point for your drive. Type
&lt;pre&gt;
mkdir temp
&lt;/pre&gt;
in the terminal.

12. Next, mount your new drive. Type
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 temp
&lt;/pre&gt;
in the terminal.

13. Now, change the permissions to your mount folder so you can write to the drive. Type
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo chmod 777 temp
&lt;/pre&gt;
in the terminal.

14. At this point, you can copy whichever files you desire to your new drive by copying them to the &quot;temp&quot; folder. You can do this in the terminal, with the file browser, etc.  Once you have finished copying the files you want to the &quot;temp&quot; folder, shut down the Whonix Workstation.

15. After the Whonix Workstation is closed, open the &quot;Virtual Media Manager&quot; in VirtualBox by clicking on &quot;File -&gt; Virtual Media Manager.&quot;

16. Locate the new VDI file you created in steps 1-7 and click on it. Then, click the &quot;copy&quot; button. When the next window appears, click the &quot;next&quot; button.

17. When prompted to choose a &quot;hard drive file type,&quot;  select &quot;VDI.&quot;

18. When prompted to choose &quot;storage on physical hard drive,&quot; choose &quot;dynamically allocated.&quot;

19. In the next window, type &quot;WhonixWorkstationFileTransfer&quot; for the drive name and then choose a folder where you wish to store it. The, click on the &quot;copy&quot; button.

20. When you are returned to the &quot;Virtual Media Manager&quot; window, click the &quot;close&quot; button.

21. Now, in the main VirtualBox window, click on the version of the Whonix Workstation that you want to copy the files into and click &quot;settings.&quot; 

22. Got to the &quot;storage&quot; section and click on the square with a + sign on it to &quot;add hard disk.&quot; It will be located next to an entry that says &quot;Controller: Whonix.&quot;

23. In the next window that appears, click on &quot;choose existing disk.&quot; Then, find where you saved the &quot;WhonixWorkstationFileTransfer.vdi&quot; file and select it.

24.When you are returned to the &quot;settings&quot; window, click &quot;OK.&quot;

25. Now, start the Whonix Workstation that you wish to copy your files into. When you reach your desktop, open a Terminal/Konsole session.

26. At the terminal command prompt, create a new directory to be the mount point for your drive. Type
&lt;pre&gt;
mkdir temp
&lt;/pre&gt;
in the terminal.

27. Next, mount your new drive. Type
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 temp
&lt;/pre&gt;
in the terminal.

28. Finally, copy the files you want into the Whonix Workstation. When you are finished copying all the files, you can shut down the Whonix Workstation and delete the temporary &quot;file transfer&quot; VDI files you used in this process through the Virtual Media Manager if you desire.

= Adding USB device to VirtualBox =
This is not recommended for security reasons.

Does '''not''' require VirtualBox Guest Additions.

Please read the chapter [[About#Whonix_is_based_on_Debian.2C_VirtualBox_and_Tor | Whonix is based on Debian]].

Means, you can change your search terms from &quot;How to get USB in Whonix-Workstation?&quot; to &quot;How to get USB in VirtualBox?&quot;.

Anyway, VirtualBox does not support USB out of the box. There are closed source additional extensions for usb support. You can download them from the [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads VirtualBox download page].

Install them on the host.

We don't know if reboot is required. Then you can plug USB devices into Virtual Machines through the device menu in VirtualBox.

Note that automount of USB devices is disabled in Whonix by default. Try, Start menu -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Removable Media or manually mount. [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/3b4b67c2/ (Old forum topic.)] [https://www.whonix.org/forum (You could start a new forum discussion to share your results.)]

Note, if you USB device is formatted with NTFS, you need to install the ntfs-3g package, and a special mount command, see &lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/c2429909/&lt;/ref&gt;.

= Shared Folder =

See [[VirtualBox Guest Additions]] chapter.

= SSH into Whonix-Gateway =
'''Developers / experts only! Only for debugging!''' &lt;br /&gt;
'''Untested in Whonix 6 (will probably work)'''

On Whonix-Gateway.

Look at the {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}} config file.

Set GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_SSH to 1.

&lt;pre&gt;GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_SSH=1&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart firewall.

&lt;pre&gt;
## On Whonix-Gateway!

sudo /usr/bin/whonix_firewall
&lt;/pre&gt;

Inside Whonix-Gateway:

&lt;pre&gt;
## On Whonix-Gateway!

## Run once.
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the host: Add port forwarding from host into Virtual Machine.

&lt;pre&gt;
## On the host!
## Open a terminal.
## Run once.
## This forwards connection from the host to 127.0.0.1:2200 to
## the SSH server running inside Whonix-Gateway on port 22.
VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; --natpf1 &quot;ssh&quot;,tcp,127.0.0.1,2200,,22

## If you ever want to undo this...
#VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; --natpf1 delete &quot;ssh&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the host: Open a ssh session.

&lt;pre&gt;
## On the host!

## as user
ssh user@127.0.0.1 -p 2200
## or as root
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2200
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the host: Or mount Whonix-Gateway as a folder.

Create a folder which will be used to mount the image. It needs to exist before trying to mount.

&lt;pre&gt;
mkdir ~/mountgateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
## On the host!

## as user
sshfs user@127.0.0.1:/ -p 2200 ~/mountgateway
## or as root
sshfs root@127.0.0.1:/ -p 2200 ~/mountgateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

= SSH into Whonix-Workstation =
'''Developers / experts only! Only for debugging!'''

You can not directly SSH into Whonix-Workstation, because Whonix-Workstation has only an internal network interface and no NAT interface. Adding one would defeat the purpose of Whonix. (See [[Security Guide]] for details why.)

Required: You mastered the steps &quot;SSH into Whonix-Gateway&quot; above.

Connection will look like this: host -&gt; ssh -&gt; Whonix-Gateway -&gt; ssh -&gt; Whonix-Workstation.

On Whonix-Workstation:

&lt;pre&gt;
## On Whonix-Workstation!
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the Whonix-Gateway:

&lt;pre&gt;
## On Whonix-Gateway!

## or user@
/usr/bin/ssh.real root@192.168.0.11
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then SSH from the host into Whonix-Gateway (host -&gt; Whonix-Gateway). From there, SSH into Whonix-Workstation (Whonix-Gateway -&gt; Whonix-Workstation). You can also do that with one command (called SSH hopping).

&lt;pre&gt;
## On the host!

## or root@
ssh -t user@127.0.0.1 -p 2200 &quot;ssh.real user@192.168.0.11&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also mount the filesystem of Whonix-Workstation with two commands. SSH hopping is also possible for sshfs (a website [http://www.larkinweb.co.uk/computing/mounting_file_systems_over_two_ssh_hops.html told] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FDYtApEP w]) me).

&lt;pre&gt;
mkdir ~/mountworkstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
## On the host!

## or root@

## SSH into Whonix-Workstation and map to localhost:2222.
ssh -f user@127.0.0.1 -p 2200 -L 2222:192.168.0.11:22 -N

## Mount Whonix-Workstation folder on the host.
sshfs -p 2222 user@127.0.0.1:/ ~/mountworkstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

If these instructions do not work for your, you can try the alternative standalone instructions [[Sshfs into Whonix-Workstation]].

= Mount and inspect images =
== Introduction ==
'''Developers / experts only! Only for debugging!'''

Required knowledge:

* You don't have to use this method. Standard ''vdi'' (or ''img'') images are used. Feel free to mount them using any other way you like.
* Mount and inspect images has been researched for only for Linux hosts. Not saying it's impossible on Windows, but it's not documented.
* You must understand understand for what ''img'' and for what ''vdi'' images are used, that's explained on the [[Dev/Source Code Intro]] page.
* You need the Whonix source code, see chapter [[Dev/BuildDocumentation_7#Get_Whonix_Source_Code|Get the Whonix source code]].
* Verify the Whonix source code with OpenPGP is not required, but recommended.
* You need some dependencies, you can install them using the {{Code|build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine}} script.

== VDI ==
=== Mount Whonix-Gateway ''vdi'' images. ===
&lt;pre&gt;sudo ./help-steps/mount-vdi -tg

cd &quot;/home/user/whonix_binary/whonix-Gateway_image&quot;
## inspect
cd ~

sudo ./help-steps/unmount-vdi -tg
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Mount Whonix-Workstation ''vdi'' images. ===
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./help-steps/mount-vdi -tw

cd &quot;/home/user/whonix_binary/whonix-Gateway_image&quot;
## inspect
cd ~

sudo ./help-steps/unmount-vdi -tw
&lt;/pre&gt;
== IMG ==

=== Mount Whonix-Gateway ''img'' images. ===
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./help-steps/mount-img -tg

cd &quot;/home/user/whonix_binary/whonix-Gateway_image&quot;
## inspect
cd ~

sudo ./help-steps/unmount-img -tg
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Mount Whonix-Workstation ''img'' images. ===
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./help-steps/mount-img -tw

cd &quot;/home/user/whonix_binary/whonix-Gateway_image&quot;
## inspect
cd ~

sudo ./help-steps/unmount-img -tw
&lt;/pre&gt;

== VMDK ==
=== Mount Whonix-Workstation ''vmdk'' images. ===
Use this method to mount any VirtualBox file type (VMDK, VDI, VHD, or raw) on a Linux host.

This method uses a VirtualBox utility named &quot;vdfuse&quot; ([http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/virtualbox-fuse virtualbox-fuse package]). It uses the VirtualBox access library to open a VirtualBox supported image file and mount it as a Fuse file system.

This step is optional. You can skip this step and come back to it if the next step fails.
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
&lt;/pre&gt;

Install the VirtualBox vdfuse utility. Note: this only works up to Debian Wheezy.
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-fuse
&lt;/pre&gt;

Edit the /etc/fuse.conf file and uncomment the line #user_allow_other and then save the file. Then, set the permissions on /etc/fuse.conf.
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo vi /etc/fuse.conf (Uncomment #user_allow_other and then save)
sudo chmod 644 /etc/fuse.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

Create a mount point and mount the Whonix Workstation image. This example shows a .vmdk file type, but any VirtualBox file type should work (VMDK, VDI, VHD, or raw).
&lt;pre&gt;
mkdir /mnt/whonix
vdfuse -f /path/to/Whonix-Workstation/Whonix-Workstation-disk1.vmdk /mnt/whonix
&lt;/pre&gt;

The path /mnt/whonix/ will now contains files like EntireDisk, Partition1, etc. Last, mount Partition1 at a second mount point.
&lt;pre&gt;
mkdir /mnt/workstation
sudo mount -o loop /mnt/whonix/Partition1 /mnt/workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, you can copy files to/from the Whonix workstation disk image.

When you are finished, unmount each of the mount points.
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo umount /mnt/workstation
sudo umount /mnt/whonix
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Warning ==
'''Warning: Not recommended!'''

* '''Weakens security in general as per [[Security Guide]] (Harden Virtualbox).'''
* Also see article, [http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=OTk5Mw The VirtualBox Kernel Driver Is Tainted Crap] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcitation.org/6HqJVN0br&lt;/ref&gt; | Opposite statements: &lt;ref&gt;http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00112.html&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00116.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clipboard sharing is disabled by default in the Virtual Box VM settings for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. Enable it only temporarily in case you really need it. Go to VirtualBox machine settings -&gt; General -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Shared Clipboard -&gt; Enable -&gt; ok.


* &lt;s&gt;Additionally they give the Virtual Machine access to the host's (built-in) microphone. Many notebooks have a built-in microphone. In case you install Guest Additions anyway, better cover it up or remove your microphone. Forum question: [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=56820 VirtualBox Forum: How disable microphone when guest additions are installed?] Feature Request: [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12023 disable microphone when guest additions are installed]&lt;/s&gt;

== Alternatives ==
* For file exchange with Whonix without installing guest additions, see [[File Transfer]].
* To get a higher screen resolution without installing guest additions, see [[Higher Screen Resolution]]

== Installing VirtualBox Guest Additions ==
=== New Instructions for Debian Wheezy ===
Very simple.

Searching&lt;ref&gt;http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&amp;keywords=virtualbox&lt;/ref&gt; for Debian packages containing VirtualBox was a wise thing. In past it was sometimes a real pain to install the guest additions. The search brought up, that honorable people created a debian package with the tools. Inside your Whonix Virtual Machine, simply do:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

## If you only want Shared Folder, for improved security,
## you can try using only the next line, but not the line after next.
# You need kernel headers to be able to compile the kernel module
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends linux-headers-$(uname -r) virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils

## If you want all features, such as dynamic resolution
## and mouse integration.
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-x11
&lt;/pre&gt;

Reboot. And you're done.

Alternatively, if this fails, you could also refer to the upstream documentation, [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html VirtualBox: Chapter 4. Guest Additions].

NOTE: Sometimes after reboot the Workstation guest fails to pick up a new resolution. Try to change the screen resolution manually a few times, from KDE settings. Once it succeeds to change to fullscreen, the change will stay persistent across reboots.

=== (Instructions for Debian Jessie) ===
Recommend avoid for Guest Additionsǃ This version is difficult to get working with guest additions and vbox shares. Debian Jessie has the issue that Whonix installs with Kernel 3.10 and the distro is at 3.12, and the 3.10 headers are not available. Therefore, it is dangerous (and unsafe) to get the Kernel headers on a different repository. Additionally, there are reports that updating the kernel can cause issues (and is also unsafe). Therefore, instead install experimental version 7.7.8.6 located at https://www.whonix.org/blog/

Noteː It has been reported that reverting Virtualbox 2 versions back with 3.10 can also solve issues. Update this wiki with your results.

=== Old instructions for Ubuntu Precise ===
Moved to [[Ubuntu]].

== Shared Folder ==
As an alternative to Shared Folders provided by VirtualBox Guest Additions, you could also have a look at the [[File Transfer]] page for alternatives.

And if you want to use the shared folder read ahead... Go to VirtualBox -&gt; machine -&gt; change -&gt; shared folder -&gt; choose a folder -&gt; use folder name '''shared'''. Choose mount automatically and create permanently. Press ok. Use the following commands to mount to folder.

&lt;pre&gt;
#sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
#sudo chmod 777 /mnt/shared
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared /mnt/shared
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you run into a '''Protocol Error''' try using a different name, do not use ''share'', use something else, anything, for example, '''shared'''. 

=== Permanently mount Shared Folder ===

After reboot, you have to repeat the mount command. If you want to mount the folder automatically, have a look at the [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/SharedFolders source] of that information or simply add '''before''' ''exit 0'' in your /etc/rc.local:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared /mnt/shared
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;
The steps.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/shared
&lt;/pre&gt;

have already been applied by {{Code|/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_shared_folder}} for your convenience.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temporary disable Guest Additions ==
'''This solution is incomplete!''' In case you want to temporarily disable VirtualBox guest additions, you can try this. A safer solution would be to uninstall them.

Find out which VirtualBox kernel modules are load.

&lt;pre&gt;cat /proc/modules | grep vbox&lt;/pre&gt;

Create a new config file for module blacklisting.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/vbox.conf&lt;/pre&gt;

And add:

&lt;pre&gt;
blacklist vboxvideo
blacklist vboxsf
blacklist vboxguest
&lt;/pre&gt;

Safe and reboot. Done.

|description=Anonymous Ubuntu. Tunnel Ubuntu through the Tor Anonymity Network using Whonix.
}}

= Most simple, least secure =

Inoffical Video, using Whonix-Gateway to torify Ubuntu.

Html5 Video. Works without Flash inside Tor Browser. Showing the Easiest, but least secure option, see [https://www.youtube.com/embed/id_l4fKqA4Q Youtube Link].

= More secure =

Tested with Debian and Ubuntu.

Download [http://www.ubuntu.com/download Ubuntu] (or use a different install CD or iso file) and verify using [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto VerifyIsoHowto].

Create a new VM and choose following settings: Under Network set Adapter 1 to &quot;Internal Network&quot;, rename &quot;intnet&quot; to &quot;Whonix&quot;.

You can use the Live environment or install Ubuntu. When the installer asks questions, generally choose the default, most common or other non-identifying options. Language: English; keymap: choose yours (potentially risk...); Country (leave it as it is): United States; User Name: leave blank; Host Name (leave it as it is): ubuntu; Time Zone (change it): UTC (it's at the very bottom); Username (account name): user. This ensures that all Whonix users have the same settings. Additionally this is more safe, when an application leaks such data, such as SSH, if you simply ssh some.host.name, it will tell your current account name, and it would be very bad if this where you real name or anything which would identify you.

Reboot into the freshly installed system and open a terminal:

Remove Ubuntu's “phone home” program(s). In a terminal type:

&lt;pre&gt;
# If installed, will not hurt if not installed.
sudo apt-get -y remove canonical-census unity-lens-shopping unity-scope-video-remote unity-scope-musicstores
&lt;/pre&gt;

Dhcp auto-configuration like software such as network manager have to be removed, since we are using static networking.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get remove isc-dhcp-client isc-dhcp-common network-manager network-manager-gnome resolvconf
&lt;/pre&gt;

Setup a fixed IP for the virtual LAN network card and to use the same subnet like the Whonix-Gateway for the Internal Network. If you use a Linux desktop with network manager you can use the GUI for this step. Otherwise: open a Terminal and type

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces&lt;/pre&gt;

You only need to configure eth0:

&lt;pre&gt;
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface, leave as it is
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp
iface eth0 inet static
# increment last octet on additional workstations
       address 192.168.0.12
       netmask 255.255.255.0
       #network 192.168.0.0
       #broadcast 192.168.0.255
       gateway 192.168.0.10
&lt;/pre&gt;

Open /etc/resolv.conf.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf&lt;/pre&gt;

and delete everything, then add

&lt;pre&gt;nameserver 192.168.0.10&lt;/pre&gt;

If you forgot to set the time to UTC you can do so at any time by type the following into the terminal:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata&lt;/pre&gt;

Now would be a good time to create a snapshot of the VM.

Update package lists.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/pre&gt;

Get latest updates.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/pre&gt;

Now would be a another good time to create a snapshot of the VM.

= Guest additions for Ubuntu =

Optional. '''Warning: Not recommended!''' Weakens security as per [[Security Guide]].

You can try first, if [[VirtualBox Guest Additions]] work on Ubuntu, because they are a bit shorter and easier.

Otherwise...

On the host:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso&lt;/pre&gt;

Inside Whonix-Workstation:

Execute the following commands. They can take a very long time, due to the Ubuntu upstream bug.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dpkg/+bug/947664 Unpacking linux-headers unbelievably slow in Lubuntu Precise (Beta 1)] (Affects Ubuntu precise final as well.)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-generic-pae
&lt;/pre&gt;

Insert the guest additions iso by clicking on the VM -&gt; devices -&gt; install guest additions.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sr0
sudo mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/sr0
sudo sh /mnt/sr0/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or start autorun.sh (not with a console, strange bug!).

Force remove CD eject.

Reboot. Done.

== About Ubuntu ==

'''TODO: This chapter needs revision.''' Incorporate latest developments: [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/privacy-ubuntu-1210-amazon-ads-and-data-leaks Privacy in Ubuntu 12.10: Amazon Ads and Data Leaks]

While Ubuntu is one of the more secure (See [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features Overview]) Linux distributions it's by no means a secure operating system. It is designed first and foremost to bring Linux to end users. It doesn't protect against some of the threat models that some Tor users will have.

Here's an (incomplete) list of things the more paranoid user will have to consider:

''apt-get'' as currently used in Ubuntu does not protect against a ''stale mirror attack'' ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/716535 Bug #716535: Please support Valid-Until in release files for security.ubuntu.com]) where an adversary provides validly signed but outdated metadata to prevent users from downloading and installing the latest critical security updates. When fetching updates over tor this problem is of a lesser extent because no single malicious exit relay will realistically prevent users from downloading updates more than once in a row. Malicious mirror is possible but Whonix-Workstation uses the main US mirror, any irregularities will be uncovered pretty soon. More of concern is the clear text update of the host operating system. Here it's a good idea to manually check how old the repository metadata is yourself:

&lt;pre&gt;find /var/lib/apt/lists/* -type f | xargs cat | grep &quot;Date: &quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

From time to time vulnerabilities that allow installation of untrusted code are discovered in apt. New security features are often implemented in Debian first.

The Ubuntu server kernel comes with everything and the kitchen sink. At any given day the kernel will be vulnerable in one way or the other. It's by far the most patched piece of code in the default Ubuntu Server installation, obviously runs at full kernel privileges and naturally can't be protected with mandatory access control. Whonix-Gateway exposes the kernel to attacks through its firewall, TCP/IP stack and whatever kernel calls Tor does or could be compelled to do.

[http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html checksec.sh] --kernel reports good kernel protection: GCC stack protector support, Enforce read-only kernel data, Restrict /dev/mem and /dev/kmem access are all enabled!

Userland protection for Tor is great. &lt;ref&gt;This would only apply if you created a Custom-Whonix-Gateway.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike TBB bundles the tor version distributed via the .deb comes with RELRO, canaries etc. and can fully make use of ASLR since it's compiled as PIE. Of course with Grsec the entropy would be higher.

|description=Anonymize Files - Clear Metadata - Remove Location Tracking - Use the Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit (MAT)
}}

[[Image:mat.png|MAT - Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit|thumb]]

= What is Metadata? =
Office documents, pictures, videos and other files contain lots of information in the meta tags that may deanonymize their author. Before uploading them to the Internet you should remove this meta data.

For more information about metadata please read the [https://mat.boum.org/ MAT] website. Information about metadata can also be found on the Warning page, see [[Warning#Whonix_doesn.27t_clear_the_metadata_of_your_documents | Whonix doesn't clear the metadata of your documents]].

= Guidelines =

Metadata can not be used to de-anonymization, if you follow the following guidelines:

* Always think twice before uploading anything.
* Upload files only, which you, either:
** created inside your Whonix-Workstation
** downloaded using your Whonix-Workstation
** carefully scrubbed yourself
* For example, if you want to upload photos or videos, unless you know what you are doing, get a separate camera, which you only use for anonymous usage.
* Keep in mind that even if de-anonymization is not possible, identity correlation to the same pseudonym might still happen. For example, let's suppose you created a video using a video creation software and uploaded it to a popular video portal under the pseudonym A. Then you created another video using the same software on the same machine and uploaded it under the pseudonym B. An adversary checking the metadata could correlate pseudonym A with pseudonym B.
* Look into [https://mat.boum.org/ MAT] (Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit). Preinstalled on Whonix.

= MAT - Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit =

Start graphical user interface from start menu:

&lt;pre&gt;Start menu button -&gt; Applications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit&lt;/pre&gt;

Or the command line interface:

&lt;pre&gt;
mat
# or for gui
mat-gui
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add the files you want to clean to the list. The &quot;dirty&quot; state indicates that the file contains removable metadata. After cleaning, the cleaned files will be created in the same directory as the original files with the extension &quot;.cleaned&quot;.

= Operating System =

== Recommendation to install latest security updates on all systems ==

'''1. Important! Everything must stay current.'''

Check at least at a daily base. Keep your host operating system updated. Update Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation packages lists.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then upgrade.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''2. Never install unsigned packages!'''

If you see something like this.

&lt;pre&gt;
WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
  icedove
Install these packages without verification [y/N]?
&lt;/pre&gt;

Don't proceed! Press {{Code|N}} and {{Code|&lt;enter&gt;}}. Ruining {{Code|apt-get update}} again should fix it. If not, something is broken or it's a man-in-the-middle attack, which isn't that unlikely, since we are updating over Tor exit relays and some of them are malciious. Try to [[Arm#Arm|change your Tor circuit]].

'''3. Changed Configuration Files'''

If you see something like the following.

&lt;pre&gt;
Setting up ifupdown ...
Configuration file `/etc/network/interfaces'
 ==&gt; Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==&gt; Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : background this process to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** interfaces (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? N
&lt;/pre&gt;

Be careful. If the updated file isn't coming from Whonix specific package (called {{Code|whonix-...}}), then press {{Code|n}}. Otherwise anonymity/privacy/security settings deployed with Whonix might get lost. If you are an advanced user and know better, you can of course manually check the difference and merge them.

How could you find out if the file is coming from a Whonix specific package or not?

* Whonix specific packages are always called {{Code|whonix-...}}. In the example above it's saying &quot;{{Code2|Setting up ifupdown ...&quot;}}, so the file isn't coming from a Whonix specific package. In this case, you should press {{Code|n}} as advised in the paragraph above.
* If the package name does include {{Code|whonix-...}}, it's a Whonix specific package. In that case, your safest bet should be pressing {{Code|y}}, but then you would loose your customized settings. You can re-add them afterwards. Such conflicts will hopefully rarely happen, if you use [[Whonix_Configuration_Files|Whonix modular flexible .d style configuration folders]].

= Whonix-Gateway Security =
== General ==
You should never use Whonix-Gateway for anything other than running Tor on it!

In case the Whonix-Gateway is compromised the identity (public IP), all destinations and all clear-text (and hidden service) communication over Tor is available to the attacker.

If you feel you need to install any extra packages on the Gateway please consult the developers first to ask if that is really necessary/wise.

== Warning: Bridged Networking ==
You shouldn't change the Whonix-Gateway's first or second network interface to bridged network. This is untested. It should not be necessary. If you feel it is necessary, please get in [[contact]].

If you are interested, here is a [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/1e6a8675/ discussion thread], and [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/3a0b673a/ another one], with arguments whether NAT or bridged network is more secure.

== Control Port Filter Proxy ==
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
There have been some [[Special:AWCforum/st/id201/|discussions]] about deactivating [[Dev/Control Port Filter Proxy]].

If you are interested, click on Expand on the right.
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
'''UNFINISHED!'''

On Whonix-Gateway.

Create {{Code2|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_disable_cpfp_user}} config file.

&lt;pre&gt;
echo 'CONTROL_PORT_FILTER_PROXY_ENABLE=0' | sudo tee &quot;/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_disable_cpfp_user&quot; &gt; /dev/null
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check.

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_disable_cpfp_user
&lt;/pre&gt;

Should show what we echoed above.

If you want to undo this configuration, see footnote. &lt;ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo rm /etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_disable_cpfp_user
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Reload Whonix Firewall.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo whonix_firewall
&lt;/pre&gt;

On Whonix-Workstation.

Create {{Code2|/etc/sdwdate.d/50_user}} config file.

&lt;pre&gt;
echo 'DISPATCH_PREREQUISITE=&quot;true&quot;' | sudo tee --append &quot;/etc/sdwdate.d/50_user&quot; &gt; /dev/null
&lt;/pre&gt;

For technical explanation, see footnote. &lt;ref&gt;
See {{Code2|/etc/sdwdate.d/30_sdwdate_default}} and read the comments above DISPATCH_PREREQUISITE. In essence, this defines a command which is supposed to return whether the network is functional or not. &quot;{{Code2|true}}&quot; is a bash command, which just returns 0 (success) without checking anything.

Maybe a better connection check utility can be written than having none.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Check.

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /etc/sdwdate.d/50_user
&lt;/pre&gt;

Should show what we echoed above.

Restart sdwdate.

&lt;pre&gt;
timesync
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to undo this configuration, see footnote. &lt;ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo rm /etc/sdwdate.d/50_user
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

= Host Security =

== Basics ==

Please read the [[Pre Install Advice#Host Security|Pre Install Advice about Host Security]].

== Risks through hardware components ==

Assumption: an adversary managed to break out of Whonix-Workstation's Virtual Machine using an exploit.

Hardware components, either built in or extra components, such as CPU or hdd temperature sensors, microphones and cameras introduce risks.

Whonix with [[Physical Isolation]] is affected:

* User's IP address is still safe, but the temperature sensors can be used for anonymity set reduction. Different CPU or hdd models will have a different sensor information, depending on climate and weather. If you can, you are advised to remove or to obfuscate the sensors result.
* Camera and microphones can be covertly activated by the adversary. At least remove them (external ones) or disable them in BIOS if possible. Better cover them or ideally remove them.

Whonix Default version is affected, although it does not matter:

* Same as above applies. If the assumption is true, the adversary can already find out the user's real IP address.

Thanks to Robert Ransom for pointing out this issue.

== Anonymous 3G modem ==

Normally your dial up or broadband provider knows your name, postal address and non-anonymous payment method. This is bad. Suppose Tor or Whonix is compromised. An adversary just has to pressure your provider and can very easily find out your identity. This is not the case here.

* Plugged or integrated into Whonix-Gateway
* Buy the 3G modem anonymously (in a store, second hand, on street, no personal data).
* Be sure to have never used it for non-anonymous use before.
** Because in many countries the telecommunication company log the phone serial number (IMEI), the SIM serial number and the phone number for each network login.
* Also be sure to buy the SIM-card anonymously.
* Prepaid is better.
* Buy cash codes in different stores anonymously.
* Be sure, to never have used this anonymous SIM-card with a non-anonymous phone or 3G model.
** Because in many countries the telecommunication company log the phone serial number (IMEI), the SIM serial number and the phone number for each network login.
** Optionally, always get a fresh, distant, random, non-circle spot. (security vs. comfort)
** Check of cameras and witnesses.
* 3G users often get only a shared IP. Due to scarcity of IPv4 IP's, thousands of users share the same external IP (IPv4). Some providers do not log yet user's (NAT) ports. Consequently they can not identify them, when they are given an IP and timestamp. Nice to have, but don't rely on it! (Some providers assign additional IPv6 IP's to their users, which are unique. Tor does not use IPv6 yet.)

== Anonymous WiFi adapter ==

Normally your dial up or broadband provider knows your name, postal address and non-anonymous payment method. This is bad. Suppose Tor or Whonix is compromised. An adversary just has to pressure your provider and can very easily find out your identity. This is not the case here.

* Plugged or integrated into Whonix-Gateway.
* Buy the wifi adapter anonymously (In a store, second hand, on street, no personal data).
* Be sure to have never used it for non-anonymous use before.
** Because a few providers or hotspot providers log the MAC address and the username (for paid hotspots) for each dial up.
* Use only free hotspots or pay them anonymously (if that's possible, otherwise abstain from paid hotspots).
** Optionally, always get a fresh, distant, random, non-circle spot. (security vs. comfort)
** Check of cameras and witnesses.

== Hardening ==

Whonix does not yet improve host security. You are advised to use a secure host operating system.

= Virtualization Platform =

== Harden Virtualbox ==

For an overview on security risks of VMs in general: [http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3056/how-secure-are-virtual-machines-really-false-sense-of-security How secure are Virtual Machines really?]

The less features, the smaller the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface attack surface]. Here are some suggestions for features which you can remove and not impact core functionality:

* Disable Audio
* Do not enable Shared Folders
* Do not enable video acceleration
* Do not enable Serial Port
* Do not install VirtualBox Guest Additions
** They weaken security in general.
** Additionally they give the Virtual Machine access to the host's (built-in) microphone. Many notebooks have a built-in microphone. In case you install Guest Additions anyway, better cover it up or remove your microphone.
* Remove Floppy drive
* Remove CD/DVD drive
* Do not attach USB devices
* Do not enable Remote Display server
* Do not enable IO APIC, EFI? (questionable)
* Enable PAE/NX? (NX is a security feature)

For the best security, you should consider using multiple physical systems, see [[Physical Isolation]].

= Whonix-Workstation Security =

== Introduction ==

If this VM is compromised all data it has access to, all credentials, browser data, passwords... the user has entered can be compromised. The IP is never leaked but these information can still result in identity disclosure.

The best practice is to create snapshots of the VM and &quot;roll back&quot; after risky activity and whenever the user suspect the integrity of the system could have been compromised, see the ''Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots'' below.

''Whonix Example Implementation'' is currently based on Debian.

For Technical Design notes, see [[Dev/Operating System]]. For information on how to use other operating systems, see [[Other Operating Systems]].

== Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots ==

Apart from offering protection against hardware serial leaks, VMs got another great advantage: the ability to quickly discard and restore a system.

It is recommended that you keep a master copy of Whonix-Workstation, keep it updated, make regular &quot;clean&quot; snapshots but do not edit any settings or install additional software or use it directly for any activity. Instead make a clone or use snapshotting (but never mix up clean and unclean states!) for activities that require anonymity.

== Adding NAT adapter to Whonix-Workstation / Updates without Tor ==

Obviously the anonymity will get compromised if you add another NAT network adapter to the Whonix-Workstation. It is quite clear not to do that. If you were infected, it could leak then. Therefore it's recommended to do updates over Tor. It's slow but there are no leaks.

== Adding Host-Only Networking adapter to Whonix-Workstation / SSH into Whonix-Workstation ==

One might wish to access the Whonix-Workstation through SSH. Therefore one could add a second network adapter with [http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_hostonly Host-Only Networking]. Dangerous! Don't add another network adapter! Also potentially dangerous if any other VMs are running besides Whonix-Workstation! This would expose the MAC address of your host to Whonix-Workstation.

The warning of VMware Host Only networking may also apply to Whonix:

''&quot;If you install the proper routing or proxy software on your host computer, you can establish a connection between the host virtual Ethernet adapter and a physical network adapter on the host computer. This allows you, for example, to connect the virtual machine to a Token Ring or other non-Ethernet network.''

''On a Windows 2000, Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 host computer, you can use host-only networking in combination with the Internet connection sharing feature in Windows to allow a virtual machine to use the host's dial-up networking adapter or other connection to the Internet. See your Windows documentation for details on configuring Internet connection sharing.&quot;''

# If you want to SSH or VNC your Whonix-Workstation your safest bet would be to do it from another Whonix-Workstation. When using Virtual Machines, if they are within the same virtual LAN, they can see each other. When using [[Physical Isolation]], if they are within the same LAN, they can see each other.
# Or you could run those services using [[Hidden Services]] and access them through another Whonix-Workstation...
# ...or from the host using the ordinary torification methods.
# Alternatively you could SSH from the host into Whonix-Gateway (see [[File Transfer]] for instructions) and SSH from there [[File_Transfer#SSH_into_Whonix-Workstation|into Whonix-Workstation]].

In case 3 and 4, you would weaken isolation between the host and Whonix-Workstation.

== Hardening: AppArmor ==
Eventually check out Whonix's [[AppArmor]] profiles. Still in testing, not that difficult and considerable gain.

= Installing additional software =

See [[Install Software]].

= Updating with extra care =

See [[Install Software#How to install or update with most caution?|How to install or update with most caution?]].

= Other Anonymizing Networks over Tor UDP Tunnel =

If you are [[Tunnel UDP over Tor|Tunneling UDP over Tor]] to connect to [[Other Anonymizing Networks]] you must read this chapter, otherwise you can skip this one.

Read first: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor Plus VPN or Proxy] and [[Whonix:General_disclaimer#Whonix_VPN_disclaimer|Whonix VPN disclaimer]].

You should beware that because you need to install additional tunnel software (OpenVPN, etc.), once exploits are found, an attacker could target them.

However, when you are using a secure tunnel software (for example, OpenVPN, not PPTP), the Tor exit relay may not read your communication with the VPN provider. It can only recognize, a encrypted VPN connection to the VPN provider.

The VPN provider can find out, depending on the other anonymizing network design, that you are connecting to that network. The VPN provider won't know who you are, but can find out, that someone is connecting over Tor.

The encryption of the tunnel software is not relevant, because the other anonymizing network most likely will make use of encryption itself. Subsequently neither the Tor exit relay nor the VPN provider will know the content of your other anonymizing network connection. The usefulness of the information, the Tor exit relay and the VPN provider can gather, is minimal.

&quot;Normally Tor switches frequently its path through the network. When you choose a permanent destination X, you give away this advantage, which may have serious repercussions for your anonymity.&quot; as mentioned applies.

It's recommended to use a dedicated virtual machine for this activity, see [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].

|description=Is Whonix trustworthy? Is there a backdoor in Whonix? How does Whonix protect itself from backdoors?
}}
= Introduction =
Trust is a very problematic issue, and that's the essence of why security is difficult in every field, including computers and Internet communication. Do you trust Whonix and its developers? Do you think we have planted backdoors in Whonix so we can take control of your computer, or that we make Whonix generate compromised encryption keys in order to enable the government to spy on you? Do you simply trust our word on that we are legit?

No matter what your opinion is in this matter you should ask how you reached that conclusion. Both trust and distrust need to be established based on facts, not gut feeling, paranoid suspicion, unfounded hearsay or our word. Of course, we claim to be honest, but written assurances are worthless. In order to make an informed decision you must look at the greater picture of what Whonix is comprised of, our affiliations, and possibly how others trust us.

== Free software and public scrutiny ==

Free software, like Whonix, enables its users to check exactly what the software distribution consists of and how it functions since the source code must be made available to all who receive it. Hence a thorough audit of the code can reveal if any malicious code, like a backdoor, is present. Furthermore, with the source code it is possible to build the software, and then compare the result against any version that is already built and being distributed, like the Whonix ova images you can download from sourceforge.net. That way it can be determined whether the distributed version actually was built with the source code, or if any malicious changes have been made.

Of course, most people do not have the knowledge, skills or time required to do this, but due to public scrutiny anyone can have a certain degree of implicit trust in Free software, at least if it is popular enough that other developers look into the source code and do what was described in the previous paragraph. After all, there is a strong tradition within the Free software community to publicly report serious issues that are found within software.

== Trusting Debian GNU/Linux ==

The vast majority of all software shipped in Whonix comes from the &lt;code&gt;Debian GNU/Linux distribution&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debian.org/&lt;/ref&gt;. Debian is the Linux distribution whose software packages are arguably under the deepest public scrutiny. Not only is Debian itself one of the largest Linux distros, but it's also one of the most popular distros to make derivatives from. Ubuntu Linux, for instance, is a Debian derivative, and the same goes transitively for all of its derivatives, like Linux Mint. Thus there are countless people using Debian's software packages, and countless developers inspect their integrity. Very serious security issues have been discovered (like the infamous &lt;code&gt;Debian SSH PRNG vulnerability&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EnxsukxM w])&lt;/ref&gt;, but backdoors or other types of intentionally placed security holes have never been found to our knowledge.

== Trusting Tor ==

Whonix anonymity is based on Tor, which is developed by &lt;code&gt;The Tor Project&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/&lt;/ref&gt;. The development of Tor is under a lot of public scrutiny both academically (research on attacks and defenses on onion routing) and engineering-wise (Tor's code has gone through several external audits, and many independent developers have read through the sources for other reasons). Again, security issues have been reported, but nothing malicious like a backdoor -- we would argue that it's only uninformed conspiracy theorists that speculate about deliberate backdoors in Tor these days. Furthermore, Tor's distributed trust model makes it hard for a single entity to capture an individual's traffic and effectively identify them.

== Trusting Whonix ==

One could say that Whonix is the union of Debian and Tor. What we do, essentially, is gluing it all together. Hence, if you trust Debian and The Tor Project, what remains to establish trust for Whonix is to trust our &quot;glue&quot;. As has been mentioned, Whonix is Free software, so its source code is completely open for inspection, and it's mainly comprised by a specification of which Debian software packages to install, and how they should be configured. While Whonix surely doesn't get the same amount of attention as Debian or Tor, &lt;s&gt;we do have some eyes on us from especially the Tor community, and also some of the general security community (see our [[Security Reviews and Feedback|audits page]].&lt;/s&gt; Given that Whonix source code is comparably small and devoid of complexities, we're in a pretty good spot compared to many other projects of similar nature. Our specification and design document (See [[Design]].) is a good starting point to understand how Whonix works, by the way.

With all this in light (which you ideally also should try to verify), you should be able to make an informed decision on whether or not you should trust our software.

= How can I trust the download images? =
Don't trust 'us'! You don't know us. Never trust people you don't know, especially not on the internet. Even if you decided to blindly trust Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer for some strange reason, well, Patrick feels honored, but since Whonix is/could become a high profile target, it's a bad idea to assume, that Patrick's build machine is clean from sophisticated targeted attacks.

You can trust these binary images to some extent if you can verify that you get exactly the same code as hundreds of other users (you can check sourceforge how often the builds where downloaded) and no one found and publicly reported any security issue. In order to verify that, beginning from Whonix 0.4.5 OpenPGP signatures are uploaded.

Sourceforge ensures some trust and integrity of the hash file through TLS (check the certificate), unfortunately only for users who are registered and logged in.

Binary releases and source code tags for releases are OpenPGP signed by Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer. The Whonix project exists since 2012-01-11. (Earlier project names were TorBOX and aos ([[History]]).)

[[Trust#Verifiable_Builds|Verifiable Builds]] allow auditors to check if there is hidden code inside Whonix.

If that's not good enough, you are very much welcome to build your own Whonix images using the [[BuildDocumentation]]. It is easy.

= OpenPGP =
OpenPGP: Usually you get a fingerprint on a web site (insecure, or secured with the broken TLS) and then download that from a key server (insecure, or secured with the broken TLS). Unless you have attended any key signing parties and have a trust path to everyone you need to connect with, OpenPGP is only as secure as TLS!

To mitigate this, it is recommended to check OpenPGP fingerprint from multiple &quot;secure&quot; sites. Bonus points for using different authentication systems. For example: https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en AND http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/signing-keys.html.en. Note that hidden services do not offer very strong authentication. A powerful adversary is more likely than not able to impersonate a hidden service, but together with multiple sources it becomes increasingly costly and improbably that a single adversary can impersonate all of them.

Binary downloads are OpenPGP signed by Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer. The source code is available from github over TLS, you can git clone over https. Each release git tag is OpenPGP signed by Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer. If desired, you can request signed git development tags from Patrick Schleizer.

Whonix developer ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Eny0UfAI w]), [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/proper?version=1 named proper in past] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Fg1zUNeQ w]), [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/proper?version=6 renamed itself to adrelanos] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Fg2p2YK3 w]), [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/proper?version=3 published its OpenPGP key on 05/29/12] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Fg336X1H w]) ([https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/proper?action=history wiki history] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6Fg24cX1W w])).

The OpenPGP key ensures, should the Whonix infrastructure ever be compromised by a powerful adversary (domain seizure/takeover etc.), that the original Whonix developers can at least prove, that they are the same people who owned the infrastructure.

Even if you distrust Whonix developers, OpenPGP verifying binary downloads or git tags is still useful. If you want to audit Whonix, you should ensure, that you actually got your download from Whonix developers and that no third party tampered with it. Examples:

= Whonix Updates =
== Introduction ==
Whonix provides an optional updater since Whonix 6.

* When &lt;u&gt;[[Dev/Build Documentation|building]] from source code&lt;/u&gt;, since Whonix 7.3.3, Whonix's APT Repository is &lt;u&gt;disabled by default.&lt;/u&gt; If you are extra paranoid want to delete all Whonix APT Repository related code, get into Whonix source code folder and delete the following two files, see footnote. &lt;ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
rm --verbose whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_whonix_apt_key
rm --verbose whonix_shared/usr/bin/whonix_repository

## Not really necessary.
rm --verbose man/whonix_shared/whonix_repository.8.ronn
rm --verbose whonix_shared/etc/whonix.d/30_aptrepository_default
&lt;/pre&gt;

You have to do this every time you are upgrading Whonix from source code.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* For the &lt;u&gt;Default-[[Download]]-Version&lt;/u&gt;, Whonix's APT Repository is &lt;u&gt;enabled by default.&lt;/u&gt; While building Whonix using the build script, Whonix's APT repository has been added to {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list}} and Whonix's (adrelanos's) APT repository OpenPGP signing key has been added to apt-key by the {{Code2|whonix_repository}} tool.

When Whonix's APT Repository is enabled and updated Whonix debian packages are uploaded to Whonix's APT repository, next time you are upgrading your system using &quot;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade&quot;, those packages will automatically get installed. If this is not what you want, this can be [[Whonix-APT-Repository#Disable_Whonix_APT_Repository|disabled]]. Below is a security discussion about the implications.

Alternatively, you can [[Dev/Build Documentation|update Whonix from source code]].

At the moment, Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer is the only one holding the Whonix APT repository OpenPGP signing key.

When it comes to trust, there is a big difference if you are building Whonix from source code or if you are using the Default-Download-Version. When you build Whonix using the build script and verified the source code to be non-malicious and reasonable bug free, Whonix developers have no way to access your system. With Whonix's APT repository enabled however, Whonix developers holding a Whonix repository signing key could always release a malicious update and gain full access on your machines.

When using the Default-Download version, on one hand, when not using Whonix's APT repository, Whonix developers could sneak in a backdoor into the binary builds (download version) (the rest of this page above goes into this subject), which is worse enough. And on the other hand, while using Whonix's APT repository, Whonix developers could sneak in a backdoor at any time. Also notable, while the binary builds contain binary packages (which are downloaded from Debian repository while building), which makes it easier to sneak a backdoor in, the Whonix deb packages do not contain any compiled code yet (only configuration files, scripts, comments) (which might change with a malicious update). As long as there is no compiled code inside Whonix deb packages, it might be easier for auditors, to catch a backdoor in updated deb packages (unless its a targeted attack) compared to the binary builds (download version).

When Whonix's APT repository is disabled, there is no updater and the situation is the same as in Whonix 0.5.6 and below.

The least secure and most convenient way is to use Whonix is using Whonix-Default-Download and to leave Whonix's repository enabled.

It's a bit safer to use Whonix-Default-Download version and to disable Whonix's APT repository. When updated Whonix deb packages are released, download them manually, verify them manually and install them manually. Big security bonus points for verifying the deb package contents before installing them. You'll get most security, if you [[Dev/Build_Documentation|build Whonix from source code]] and also build update packages from source code. Big security bonus points for verifying the source code before building Whonix.

== What do Digital Signatures Prove and What They DO NOT Prove ==
Most people, even programmers, often confuse the basic ideas behind digital signatures. Most people should read this section, even if it looks trivial at first sight.

Digital Signatures can prove, that a given file is authentic, i.e. that is has been indeed created by a person that signed it, and that its contents have not been tampered (so, integrity is preserved).

Digital Signatures do '''not''' prove any other property, e.g. that the file is not malicious. In fact there is nothing that could stop people from signing a malicious program (and it happens from time to time in reality).

The point is, of course, that people need to choose to trust some people, e.g. Linus Torvalds, Microsoft, etc. and assume that if a file(s) was indeed signed by those individuals, then indeed it should not be malicious and buggy in some horrible way. But the decision of whether to trust certain people (e.g. those behind the Whonix Project) is beyond the scope of digital signatures. It's more of a sociological and political decision.

However, once we make a decision to trust somebody (e.g. The Whonix Project and the files released by them), then the digital signatures are useful, because they make it possible to limit our trust only to those few people we chose, and not to worry about all the Bad Things That Can Happen In The Middle between us and them (i.e. the vendor), like e.g.: server compromises, dishonest IT staff at the hosting company, dishonest staff at the ISPs, WiFi attacks, etc.

If we verify all the files we download from the vendor, we don't need to worry about all the above bad things, because we would easily be able to detect when the file(s) has been tampered (and not execute/install/open them).

However, for the digital signatures to make any sense, one should ensure that the public keys we use for signature verification are indeed the original ones. Anybody can generate a OpenPGP key pair that would pretend to be for &quot;Whonix Project&quot;, but only the key pair that I (Patrick Schleizer) generated is the legitimate one. Securely obtaining Whonix signing key is documented on a later page, [[Whonix Signing Key]].

&lt;code&gt;TLS/SSL/HTTPS with the CA model is flawed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[SSL]].&lt;/ref&gt; We don't trust it and you shouldn't either. Even if all the implementation details (revocation not working, every CA can issue certs for anything, including &quot;*&quot;) were sorted out, having to trust a 3rd party is a no go. But, we still have to rely on it to some extent for that lack of a widely used web of trust or other alternative.

== Evil developer attack ==
This is only a theoretical attack, as far as we know. We are not aware that it ever happened to any software project. This is not a Whonix specific problem. It applies to all open source software projects, but more to those where the developers stay anonymous. Examples for such anonymously developed software projects are TrueCrypt, Tails, i2p...

The attack works like this: 1. Start a new software project. Alternatively join an existing software project. 2. Behave well, publish your sources. Gain trust. 3. Build binaries directly from your sources and offer them for download. 4. Make a great product, get a lot of users. 5. Continue to develop it. 6. Make a second branch of your sources and add malware. 7. Continue to publish your clean sources, but offer your malicious binaries for download. 8. Done! You infected a lot of users.

It is very difficult for end users to notice this attack. Of course, if all users would be added to a botnet, there would be news about this incident very soon and everyone would know. On the other hand, if the backdoor is barely used, it may remain secret for a long time.

The myth, that open source software is automatically more secure than closed source, is still strong and widespread. Yes, open source has advantages but certainly not for this threat model. Who checks if the binaries are made from the proclaimed source and publishes the results? That is called deterministic builds.&lt;ref&gt;https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/liberationtech/2013-June/009257.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3688&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite difficult to achieve that. If you are interested on how complex it is, also google 'trusting trust'.

All that is very difficult and it all comes back to trust. How can you trust developers? Even if they are not anonymous, you still do not know them and can not trust them? And even if you know them, can you trust them not to have made any mistakes?

These are serious questions to think about. Whonix is also affected by this issue, just like TrueCrypt, Tails, i2p, etc. Most projects (such as TrueCrypt) do not even inform about this fact. Whonix is just an ordinary software project, unfortunately we are unable to fix all problems in the world.

Whonix doesn't distribute any binaries, only redistributes unmodified upstream binaries, shell scripts, we do not create our own binaries. That's what we claim, but it's a lot easier to verify than if we were distributing our own binaries from source code we wrote. Users should worry about the motives and internal security of everyone contributing to torproject.org, all of the distro devs and maintainers and the hundreds of upstream devs and contributors. Trusted computing base size of a modern operating system today is so ridiculously big and so many people are involved we'd be really surprised if none of the &quot;bugs&quot; were intentional. And then there's the hardware. You think that even AMD could understand an Intel chip or vice versa? Of course one can't compare an anonymous contributor with no investment but time with a multi-national company. On the other hand, in comparison, detection here is just ridiculously simple (diff the hash sums), while finding and then proving that something is not a bug but a backdoor in a compiler, well designed source code let alone a CPU is impossible. Anonymous or not no longer matters these days. We are in a more or less open &quot;cyber war&quot; or that's what media and lawmakers want us to believe. Fact is, today players are backed by governments, they can use their real identities without fear of repercussion, fake IDs can be created, trustworthy people can be coerced into giving up their OpenPGP and ssh keys if projects even make use of any strong authentication. Judging by the lack of signatures on many open source upstream and even downstream downloads I'm sure many lack any internal security enforcement and still trust DNS to provide authenticity and clear text to provide integrity. About open source, yeah, you can bet Apple, Google and Microsoft have better internal security than the global open source community. However that doesn't make their code trustworthy or says anything about whether closed or open is more secure...

== Whonix developer OpenPGP guidelines ==
All long term Whonix developers, are encouraged to:

* Create a 4096/4096 RSA/RSA OpenPGP key.
* Get the latest gpg.conf (which comes with Whonix-Workstation) for stronger hashes, no-emit-version, etc.
* Store the private key inside an encrypted file.
* Make a backup of that encrypted file.
* Remember the password, check yourself regularly.
* Also upload the encrypted file to some (free) online cloud hosting, in case of thief, fire, tornado, etc.
* Since the project started in 2012, we believe the earlier developer published its OpenPGP public key, the less likely is it, that the developer is attempting an evil developer attack.

= Introduction =

== Intro ==

Whonix can work together with any other suited Anonymizing Networks. This means the other network will be tunneled through Tor.

'''In theory''' also Tor could be completely exchanged with any other suited anonymizing network, see [[Dev/Technical Introduction#Whonix Framework|Whonix Framework]]. Development in this area stalled due to lack of interest from users, upstream developers and Whonix developers. Anyway, there has been some research, theoretical and practical work done towards such integration, see [[Dev/Inspiration]] in case you are interested. 

'''Note that all networks differ in their threat model and security! Research before you start using them.'''

== Rudimentary Whonix Support for Other Anonymizing Networks ==

The [[Dev/Technical Introduction#Whonix Framework|Whonix Framework]] is agnostic about which Anonymizing Network is being used. Whonix started with Tor as anonymizing network, because all developers were Tor users. The idea, that also other anonymizing network could be used, came much later.

At the moment Whonix's support for Other Anonymizing Networks is only rudimentary and not as good as supported like the Tor network. Of course Whonix developers respect other anonymizing networks, their developers and their users. They are simply more accustomed to the Tor network, which is also a personal preference. It's also very hard to be equally interested, educated and to stay up to date with all other anonymizing networks at the same time.

As soon as a new developer, who actively supports the other anonymizing network, joins the Whonix project, this particular anonymizing network can be equally supported like the Tor network. For example, there is not much point in separate a 'JonDoBOX', if most of the knowledge and code is shared.

}}

== Introduction ==

'''adrelanos's JonDonym opinion'''

JonDonym is an alternative anonymity network which will be compared with Tor in this Introduction chapter. It's easy to tunnel JonDonym over Tor inside Whonix-Workstation which we go into in the next chapter. In theory, Tor on Whonix-Gateway could be replaced with JonDo.

The &lt;code&gt;JonDonym network&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net&lt;/ref&gt; is much smaller than the Tor network. At time of writing ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EDKqyxBU February 2012], snapshot random week day, random time), there were 5 two hop free mix cascades, 11 three hop premium mix cascades and 1 test/experimental free one hop service.

The two hop free mix cascades had 1940 users with a maximum available capacity of 2750 users. 1367 users were using the test/experimental free one hope service which didn't advertise a maximum user capacity. From 16 to 63 users used one of the 11 three hop premium mix cascades and no maximum user restriction was advertised. There were 350 premium users in total.

In comparison, according to Tor metrics page ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EDLmOK0g on that day] the Tor network had on that day had ~3000 relays. (~1000 had the guard flag and ~900 hard the entry guard flag, i.e. where useable in that position.) ~500.000 users were using the Tor network [http://www.webcitation.org/6EDMD01pu on that day].

The path (circuit), Tor client chooses is non-predictable and changes every 10 minutes while in comparison to JonDonym, for example a user who has chosen the Speedy-Sektor free two hop mix cascade, will have a predictable entry and exit until the user manually changes it. That goes for all mix cascades. If someone knows the entry or exit, the whole path the client is using through the network is known.

The Tor network is run by volunteers from many different countries. There is no formal process to apply as a Tor node and no verification of identity for Tor node admins. Anyone can download the Tor software and volunteer a node. Therefore there are legit and malicious nodes.

In comparison to JonDonym, mix servers are operated by independent and non interrelated organizations or private individuals who all &lt;code&gt;publish their identity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/certificates.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The operators have to abide by strict provisions which prohibit saving connection data or exchanging such data with other operators.

While private data such as usernames and passwords have been already sniffed by Tor exit relays on unencrypted or sslstripped connections, no such headline about JonDonym. Tor clearly states, that unencrypted connections can be sniffed by Tor exit relays. ([[Warning#Tor_exit_nodes_can_eavesdrop_on_communications|Exit Nodes Eavesdropping]]) Trusting in JonDonym is more like trusting in their policy and server administration skills. Neither the mix server administration nor the JonDo software can prevent a man-in-the-middle attack between the mix server and the destination server.

JonDonym might be faster than Tor.

Quoted from the JonDonym Law enforcement page &lt;ref&gt;https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/law_enforcement.html ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EDOc3Gfi w])&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;JonDonym does not make it impossible to uncover individual users, as there is no such thing as a 100% security. However, such a disclosure is by magnitudes more difficult than for other VPN or proxy services, as this would require the cooperation of several states and organizations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;JonDonym is no technology for preventing law enforcement on the internet. In very serious cases, it is possible to uncover the abuse of Mix services. User connections may be individually observed, if all operators of a Mix cascade get such an official order, valid in their respective country (in Germany accourding to §100a/b StPO).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A respective legal obligation may moreover force some Mix operators to retain certain connection data. In contrast to surveillance (where this is often not allowed), the operator has to make this transparent to the users of his JonDonym Mixes via JonDo. Usually, such a data retention does neither comprise target addresses (websites) nor contents, but IP addresses of users only. At the moment no JonDonym mix operator retain connection data.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, the independence of JonDonym operators vastly lowers the danger of an illegitimate law enforcement done by non-democratic states or arbitrary individual public officers. Any disclosure basically needs the cooperation of all operators of a Mix cascade. This was never realized for premium mix cascades in the past.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Surveillance reports&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each year, we will publish a short report of all surveillance actions that were taken and have been reported to us by the operators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2012 there has been one surveillance court order to all German mix operators and JonDos GmbH. It concerned one JonDonym account number which was known to the law enforcement agency before start of surveillance. No premium cascade and no free cascade was able to provide the requested communication data because not all operators of any cascade got a court order.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If single mix operators inform JonDos GmbH about a surveillance court order then that does not mean JonDonym as a whole has been under surveillance or JonDos GmbH was involved. Rather, single operators had to comply with these orders.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In summary there where surveillance court orders for the last four years, but until now, no JonDonym user has ever been de-anonymized. The Tor network also suffers from legal attacks, there have been some raids of Tor exit servers, which also didn't and couldn't lead to de-anonymization. Both networks, when correctly used, i.e. not de-anonymizing oneself by posting private information, without connecting once without going through the anonymity network, without proxy bypass, without viruses, following documentation and so on, ever had any news headlines about network compromise.

The JonDo developers, although they are selling a product, seem to be honest about their network. They are also generally friendly (Whonix is allowed to re-use their documentation content under Open Source license with or without modification to improve Whonix documentation) and are also constructively participating the Tor bug tracker. It will be interesting if and what they answer will be on the thread &quot;[https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=7319 ip-check.info some false values and confuses TBB users]&quot; ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EDOL0OdY w]).

The JonDonym receives much less attention from security researchers compared to Tor.

In some aspects JonDonym is more/less secure than Tor. Depends on your threat model Reading [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/jondonym.html network comparison] and [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/law_enforcement.html law enforcement] yourself may be worth reading.

Tunneling JonDonym over Tor makes sense in some cases. I wouldn't do it for a longer amount of time, as it adds a permanent exit server. (See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor plus VPN or proxy] for background.)

Conclusion: if you want to download something, which you can not download over SSL (and if there are also no hash sums or signatures), the JonDo exit might be, in your threat model, more trustable than a random Tor exit. However, you could also try to use a specific Tor exit from someone you trust.

Q/A:

According JonDo, is it safe to tunnel JonDonym over Tor (user -&gt; Tor -&gt; JonDonym)?

According to JonDo, yes.

Quoted from the JonDonym network comparison page&lt;ref&gt;https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/jondonym.html&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] making surfing considerably slower but, in some individual cases, even more secure than with JonDonym alone.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the JonDonym page, chapter &lt;code&gt;Access to the Tor network with JonDo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/services_tor.html&lt;/ref&gt;, JonDo natively supports to get tunneled over Tor. This also implies, that the JonDo developers do '''not''' argue, that tunneling JonDo through Tor is any less safe. Having such an option helps JonDo users to tunnel through Tor (user -&gt; Tor -&gt; JonDonym). You won't need this option in Whonix, since all traffic originating from Whonix-Workstation, will be tunneled through Tor first in any case. Enabling that JonDo option is inside Whonix-Workstation is discouraged, since it would lead in Tor over Tor. 

== JonDonym over Tor inside Whonix-Workstation ==
=== JonDo ===
You can tunnel JonDonym over Tor. This could be useful, to circumvent Tor bans. But note [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor Plus VPN or Proxy] (it adds a permanent exit relay, like explained and the article). Not many changes are required. Either [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/software.html download] and install it as usual. You need 'JonDo – the IP changer', either as the gui or console version.

Or you could try to install from their GNU/Linux repository. They have their own documentation page about the [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/firststeps2.html JonDo repository]. Whonix is based on Debian Wheezy. The only difference when using their repository instructions is, that your distribution is wheezy and not maverick.

For better security, its recommended to download their signing key over https with your browser, i.e. where it says &quot;The repository is signed with the OpenPGP key 0xF1305880&quot; right click on 0xF1305880 and save as. Save it in your home folder and use &quot;gpg --import 0xF1305880&quot;. Downloading the key from a keyserver with apt-key would be less secure.&lt;ref&gt;Less secure using the short key fingerprint as in JonDo documentation. Using the long key fingerprint should be equally secure.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== JonDoFox vs Tor Browser ===
You must make an informed decision, if you prefer to use JonDoFox or the Tor Browser.

A quick thought tells me, that blending in with JonDo users, i.e. using JonDoFox in this case would make more sense - could be wrong. No special settings would be required in this case.

If you want to use the Tor Browser for surfing -&gt; user -&gt; Tor -&gt; JonDonym -&gt; destination server, you have to change the proxy settings in Tor Button. start Tor Browser, open Tor Button settings, choose custom proxy settings, http 127.0.0.1 port 4001 and leave all other fields expect no proxy for 127.0.0.1 free. You can check http://ip-check.info/ if it's working.

=== Future ===
If you are interested in a development discussion about JonDo(Fox) getting pre-installed on Whonix, see [[Dev/JonDo]].

|description=Authenticated / Encrypted Connections between Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation, ARP spoofing defense, SSH, OpenVPN, Using additional (isolated) network interfaces
}}
== Introduction ==

'''This chapter is only important, if you do not use the Default/Download (host + VM + VM) version.''' You should read it if you are using Physical Isolation or for any kind of custom, non-stock configurations.

=== Basics ===

By Whonix default, it is assumed, that Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation are connected by (virtual) LAN cable. Wireless technologies are recommended against, because a malware compromised Whonix-Workstation could jump to other wireless access point and subsequently connect without Tor. Using a (virtual) cable enforces, that Whonix-Workstation can only connect through Whonix-Gateway. For the same reason connections to Whonix-Gateway over internet are recommended against as well.

By Whonix default, connections between Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway are not authenticated/encrypted. This is because of the assumption above. The connection between Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway is assumed to be secure. &lt;ref&gt;Secure means, you assume that no one on your (virtual) LAN is going to MITM &lt;/ref&gt; Adding authentication/encryption by default would also greatly increase complexity of Whonix, which is what we want to avoid in the first place for reasons explained in earlier chapters.

In case you want to run multiple Whonix-Workstations at the same time inside the same (virtual) isolated LAN, you should add authentication:

* Inside virtual LANs:
** Authentication is enough.
** No encryption is required.
*** When no machines can be impersonanted, no MITM is possible inside the virtual LAN.
* Inside real LANs:
** You only need encryption if in your threat model includes the possibility for a MITM.

In case you want to connect to Whonix-Gateway over insecure networks (internet):

* You should add encryption and authentication.
** Encryption is required, because otherwise a MITM could eavesdrop.
** Authentication ensures, you're connecting to the right machine.
*** Most encryption solutions, such as OpenVPN or ssh also provide authentication.

=== Motivation for secure connections between Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation ===

'''Only applies to non-stock configurations''': if you run multiple Whonix-Workstations at the same time or if you want to connect to Whonix-Workstation over insecure networks (internet):

A compromised Whonix-Workstation can impersonate Whonix-Gateway or any other Whonix-Workstation inside the same (virtual) LAN, perform active MITM attacks or passively eavesdrop.

=== OpenVPN vs SSH ===

Adding encryption can be done using OpenVPN or SSH. Using SSH and not OpenVPN, has the advantage, that you can later, still easily tunnel a VPN through Tor. If you don't plan to do this, using OpenVPN is probably easier. The disadvantage of using SSH is, that it's complicated to setup for this use case. You are probably better off using OpenVPN.

== Authenticated connections between Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation ==

=== ARP spoofing defense ===

This is only been quickly researched. After reading the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing wikipedia article about ARP spoofing], it looks like ''Static ARP entries'' could be used for authenticated connections between Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

=== Using additional (isolated) network interfaces ===

(This chapter is actually not authentication, solves the threat nonetheless.)

A workaround, when using VirtualBox and running everything on the same host:

* One can also enable Virtual Network Adapter 3 and 4 and use uniquely named internal networks, for up to 3 Whonix-Workstations, which are isolated against each other.

A workaround, for Whonix with Physical Isolation, where all machines in the same trusted place:

* That Whonix-Gateway already requires two network interfaces is a though requirement. (External and internal interface.) You could theoretically also add additional interfaces for additional internal LAN interfaces.

== Encrypted and authenticated connections between Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation ==

=== Using SSH (not tested/recommended) ===

You must not allow [http://serverfault.com/questions/56566/ssh-tunneling-only-access ssh login].

Each Whonix-Workstation probably needs its own SSH account, with public key authentication and the SSH private key distributed to each T-W. Whonix-Gateway and all Whonix-Workstations need the correct SSH commands. Whonix-Gateway has to autostart SSH and to continuously listening for connections. And Whonix-Workstation has to autostart SSH as well and continuously reconnect (in case Whonix-Workstation started before Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Gateway restarted) (perhaps using autossh or something similar). All Whonix-Workstations need to use the tunnel IP, to connect to the Whonix-Gateway. And the Whonix-Gateway should reject unencrypted gateway requests, and only accept forwarding to Tor over the SSH tunnel. And also answer only over the SSH tunnel. All Whonix-Workstations must use the SSH tunnel as gateway (redirect network level to socks using tranSOCKS_ev or similar). Perhaps also changes in the Whonix-Gateway firewall are required. Taking all the into account, it looks like, it's not impossible to use SSH for this task, but it's quite complicated.

You are probably better off using OpenVPN.

=== Using OpenVPN ===

'''DRAFT! UNFINISHED!'''

Right now only supports two modes/security domains:

* Whonix-Workstations with the secret key (=trusted) and
* other workstation with no key/vpn configured.

NOTE:

* Transparent proxying doesn't seem to work at all, therefore you need to configure all applications to use socks ports.

On the gateway:

{{Old-Stable-0.5.6}}

&lt;pre&gt;sudo -i
apt-get -y install openvpn

# create a new symmetric key
sudo -u user openvpn --genkey --secret /home/user/static.key

# copy key to workstation (Firewall needs to be disabled and openssh-server installed on Whonix-Workstation for this to work)
sudo -u user scp /home/user/static.key user@192.168.0.10:/home/user/static.key

mv /home/user/static.key /etc/openvpn/static.key
chown root:root /etc/openvpn/static.key
chmod 700 /etc/openvpn/static.key

# create server configuration
echo &quot;
user nobody

dev tun
ifconfig 10.8.0.1 10.8.0.2
secret /etc/openvpn/static.key&quot; &gt; /etc/openvpn/server.conf

service openvpn restart

# Edit torrc
# TODO: only selectively change listening addresses. TransPort and optionally other SocksPorts have to remain available,
#       if unauthenticated workstations are to be used.
# NOTE: we are using a hardcoded default IP here, if you are using non standard settings this will have to be edited.

# Edit /usr/local/bin/whonix_firewall
# TODO: Put this automatically where it actually belongs
echo '

/usr/local/bin/whonix_firewall
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the Workstation(s):

TODO: Disable/tweak the new firewall

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo -i

mv /home/user/static.key /etc/openvpn/static.key
chown root:root /etc/openvpn/static.key

|description=How to use Multiple Whonix-Workstations for better separation of different pseudonyms.
}}

== Introduction ==

For tasks where you want to use additional software you should use a second (or third) VM, you can make a clone. Consider this more of a pseudonymous than an anonymous environment and act accordingly.

Multiple Whonix-Workstation VM's isolate different torified clients from each other. For example, an exploit in the browser can not read your IRC identity in another VM. However, keep in mind, if Tor inside the Whonix-Gateway or your host internet connection goes offline, all Whonix-Workstations will go offline, and if you were simultaneously using something, an attacker could guess, that you are the same person (i.e. two Tor users in one IRC channel go offline at the same moment).

The most safe thing to do is using only one Whonix-Workstation for one activity at the same time.

Leaving multiple Whonix-Workstations running at the same time introduces also new risks. One compromised Whonix-Workstation can perform various attacks. It's impossible to defeat all those attacks. Depending on the adversary's skills and assumptions and your activity in other Whonix-Workstations, he could correlate various running Whonix-Workstations to the same pseudonym.

* An adversary could stress either/and CPU, HDD, RAM, network connection and other Whonix-Workstations and perhaps also the host would suffer.
* There is no defense against DOSing other Whonix-Workstations or the Whonix-Gateway.
* The adversary could try to exploit other Whonix-Workstations or the Whonix-Gateway. This risk can be reduced by hardening. Whonix-Workstation provides an optional (disabled by default, because it can get into the way for other tasks) firewall (under {{WhonixFirewall}}) to isolate different Whonix-Workstations from each other.
* A defense against impersonating (i.e. MITM or malicious gateway) other Whonix-Workstations or the Whonix-Gateway can be implemented using authentication, this is linked in the &quot;More Security&quot; section below.

Identity correlation through circuit sharing &lt;ref&gt;See [[Stream Isolation]] page for definition.&lt;/ref&gt; is not at risk as long as the Whonix-Workstation's aren't compromised. Multiple Whonix-Workstations using different internal IP's (as recommended in the instructions below) are automatically using [[Stream Isolation]].&lt;ref&gt;Because [https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en IsolateClientAddr] is Tor's default.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to use more than one Whonix-Workstation - EASY ==

The following instructions only apply for Download/Default-Whonix-Workstations or if you build yourself from source code. If you want to use other operating systems, such as Windows, other Linux, BSD etc. please see the [[Other Operating Systems]] article instead.

To setup a second or any additional Whonix-Workstation only two minor details are required. It needs its own MAC address and its own internal LAN IP address.

(1). Additional Whonix-Workstation and separate MAC address.

Clone a clean Whonix-Workstation. This will assign a new MAC address to the newly created Whonix-Workstation.

Or in case you imported an extra Whonix-Workstation, go to VirtualBox -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network -&gt; Adapter 1 -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Mac Address -&gt; Create a new MAC address (press the green round arrow icon) -&gt; Ok.

(2). Open /etc/network/interfaces.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces&lt;/pre&gt;

(3). And change the last octet. E.g. 192.168.0.'''11''' or 192.168.0.'''12'''.

(4). Reboot or restart network using

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service networking restart&lt;/pre&gt;

(4). Done.

== How to use more than one Whonix-Workstation - More Security ==
=== Connections between Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation ===
See [[Connections between Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation]].

=== Multiple Whonix-Gateways ===
'''Advanced users only.'''

You could also use two or more Whonix-Gateways. This comes with both, advantages and disadvantages. It's more secure, in case one Whonix-Gateway got compromised, the other one is not necessarily compromised as well. A disadvantage is, that you end up with a different set of Tor entry guards - unless you take precautions&lt;ref&gt;Such as manually sharing your entry guards (no documentation ever written to my knowledge) or using the same [[Bridges]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Your ISP could guess, that you are using two different Tor data folders, for whatever that's worth. (If you are using multiple TBB's, you end up with different sets of Tor entry guards as well.

Using multiple Whonix-Gateways is more simple and more secure, when you are not using them at the same time.

When you are using them at the same time, the risks explained in the introduction chapter on this page apply. In this case, you also have to change Whonix-Gateway network interface2 and Whonix-Workstation network interface1 from internal network &quot;Whonix&quot; to something else.

|description=Computer Security Guide for Whonix Linux for Advanced Users, Whonix Hardening
}}
= Basics =

Please understand the basics first, read the [[Pre Install Advice]] first!

= Network Time Synchronization =
Don't wonder... To prevent against time zone leaks, the system clock inside Whonix was set to UTC. This means it may be a few hours before or ahead of your host system clock. Do not change!

On the host. If you were a user of TorBOX 0.2.1 or below and removed NTP, restore it now.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install ntpd&lt;/pre&gt;

VirtualBox has a feature to spoof the initial virtual hardware clock offset by setting the clock X milliseconds in feature or past. Syntax.

&lt;pre&gt;
VBoxManage modifyvm &lt;name&gt; --biossystemtimeoffset -&lt;milliseconds&gt;
VBoxManage modifyvm &lt;name&gt; --biossystemtimeoffset +&lt;milliseconds&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's prudent to add a random delay within the following range.

&lt;pre&gt;
VBoxManage modifyvm &lt;name&gt; --biossystemtimeoffset -60000
VBoxManage modifyvm &lt;name&gt; --biossystemtimeoffset +60000
&lt;/pre&gt;

Pick one example per VM and use random values within the range. (On the host.)

&lt;pre&gt;
VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; --biossystemtimeoffset -35017
VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; --biossystemtimeoffset +27931

VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot; --biossystemtimeoffset -35017
VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot; --biossystemtimeoffset +27931
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/39 planned] to automate the above steps. Help welcome.

Clock skew apart this small biossystemtimeoffset &lt;ref&gt;biossystemtimeoffset is being used, to unlink the initial clock synchronization of the VM by the Virtualizer from the host clock.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Powering on a VM will initially synchronize the clock with the host clock until Whonix Timesync adjusts it.&lt;/ref&gt; is always bad for privacy &lt;ref&gt;Can lead to linkability, thus would be [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous rather than anonymous]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

When you suspend/save the state of a VM, clock will stop and continue after resume, thus lag behind. You shouldn't suspend/save the state of Whonix-Gateway. Rather power the Gateway off, if you no longer need it. &lt;ref&gt;Otherwise Tor can get confused if time is more than 1 hour in past or more than 3 hour in future and will only reconnect to the Tor network, if clock is manually fixed or powered off and powered on again.&lt;/ref&gt; You can suspend/save the state of Whonix-Workstation, but then the clock will lag behind. To fix it run inside Whonix-Workstation Start Menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Whonix Timesync.

The host system clock synchronization mechanism still uses unauthenticated NTP from a single source. This is not optimal, but there is no real solution to this problem. &lt;ref&gt;See Design: [[TimeSync]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ISP and/or the time server could either non-intentionally or intentionally (as an attack) introduce a clock skew or the host clock could simply malfunction.

If the host clock is too much off, more than one hour in past or more than 3 hour in future, Tor can't connect to the Tor network. &lt;ref&gt;Because Tor can't verify the Tor consensus.&lt;/ref&gt; The easiest fix in this situation is to manually fix the clock on the host, to power off Whonix-Gateway and to power on Whonix-Gateway again.

Another side effect of the host clock being too much off is, that downloading operating system updates on the host and cryptographic verification, such as verifying SSL certificates on the host browser may no longer be possible, until you manually fix the clock.

Before you think, your ISP is tampering with NTP, ensure first, that not simply the host clock is defect due to an empty battery.

If you should really ever catch your ISP tampering with NTP, you should probably disable it and manually update the host clock out of band, i.e. using a watch or atomic clock. In case it isn't a large scale attack, but a targeted attack, you most likely have already bigger problems to worry about than NTP. (See Warning page chapter [[Warning#Confirmation attacks|Confirmation attacks]].)

You have also another option. You could disable NTP on your host and always manually adjust the clock out of band, i.e. using a watch or atomic clock. This might make your clearnet traffic more fingerprintable &lt;ref&gt;See [[Fingerprint]] page to find out what fingerprinting means in this case.&lt;/ref&gt;, since it introduces a device issuing clearnet traffic (at least operating system updates, I hope), but not using NTP. I don't know how many people deactivated/broken/uninstalled/never installed NTP. Neither I know, how many people are using alternative time synchronization methods such as authenticated NTP, tails_htp, tlsdate or similar. Search engine research however suggests, that very few people care and do so.

Summary:

* Needs to be done only after importing the Virtual Machine: Modify --biossystemtimeoffset for all Virtual Machines.
* Run Secure Network Time Synchronization after suspend/save/resume or do not use suspend/save/resume at all.
* Tor can't connect if the host clock is too much off. In this case manually fix the host clock, power off Whonix-Gateway and power on Whonix-Gateway again.
* Keep an eye on the host clock, ensure that it's always somewhat accurate.

Even though it's a difficult topic, you are advised to read Technical Design chapter [[TimeSync]].

= Host Security =

== Recommendation to use Whonix with Physical Isolation ==

Whonix using Physical Isolation, setup using two different computers AND virtualization. This is the most secure Tor configuration to date. Unfortunately, it is difficult to setup. See [[Physical Isolation]].

== Hardening ==

General hardening recommendations apply.

* Minimize attack surface
* securely configure services
** e.g. for ssh: use fail2ban, allow only key authentication),

Proactive Defenses

* [http://wiki.debian.org/Hardening compile time hardening]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control MAC]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system IPS])

Retroactive Defenses

* The usefulness of this approach is limited. It doesn't prevent security breaches. It can only help making future breaches less likely.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rkhunter rkhunter]
* IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snort_%28software%29 Snort]

* [http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/sxid sxid]
* antivirus, antimalware

These are only pointers for you to search the web about these topics and these are probably beyond the scope of this guide.

== One VM ==

'''One VM is deprecated.''' It was tested and developed for 0.1.3. The concept worked. It's deprecated now, because it has no maintainer.

Alternatively, you could also use one VM instead of two, where Tor runs on the host. It has some security and other kinds of advantages/disadvantages listed in the article. See [[OneVM]].

== Separate user account for VirtualBox ==

Security-wise it makes sense to create a separate user account just for using VirtualBox, which is not in the admin/sudo group.

== DMZ ==

If you are using a shared network, as in a cable modem/router or ADSL/router setup, that is shared with others, you should consider configuring a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28computing%29 DMZ] for your Whonix-Gateway.

This DMZ would restrict the Whonix-Gateway from accessing and from being accessible by other nodes on the network, eg printers, phones, computers, laptops, even if root access was somehow achieved on it.

Should an incursion occur, it would prevent the adversary from exploring other systems and possibly compromising them. It won't however do anything to protect your anonymity, because they could just ping some remote server and discover your real IP address. Or should other systems be compromised, it would be more difficult to compromise Whonix-Gateway.

== Host Firewall ==

=== Pre Install Advice ===

Installing a host firewall has been already recommended in [[Pre Install Advice#Host Firewall]].

=== Port Scan ===

Using a port scanner service on the internet to test your local LAN's router/firewall is a good idea, if you are careful to find a legitimate one instead of somebody who only wants to sell you something and will give you false positives deceptively. That's good, but even better is to run a port scan application from an external IP to scan your own IP. Either remote login (ssh) on some external machine of your own or proxy through an external IP to scan your own IP. The details on how to do so are outside the scope of this document.

However, if you are not using a stand-alone machine, but are on a LAN with other PCs, it is important to keep in mind that these testing services or your own port scan application from an external IP, actually only scan the local LAN's router/firewall, but these tests do not test your actual host's PC, which, if badly configured, could be susceptible to attacks from other machines within the LAN, behind the router. A false sense of security could be the result.

For example if you share your LAN with flatmates, who are not so sophisticated in computer security, you should regard their machines as possible malicious (may be conquered by a botnet already). Therefore you can not trust the output of a port scan application running on their machine. If you have no spare machine of your own, you could eventually boot their computer from a Live CD, which includes a port scan application, to scan your machine. The details on how to do so are outside the scope of this document.

=== NAT Router ===

Being behind an ordinary NAT router may be another tiny extra layer of security.

=== Dedicated connection ===

If possible, not sharing the network (LAN, Wi-Fi, hotspot) with other possibly compromised machines is safer.

=== Filtering Ports ===

==== Introduction ====

From time to time someone asks, which ports incoming/outgoing Whonix-Gateway requires. The answer is.

* incoming: none
* outgoing: all

==== Incoming ====

Whonix-Gateway itself does not open any ports. Closing ports on the host is still advised. That was already covered in the [[Pre_Install_Advice#Host_Firewall|Pre Install Advice, chapter Host Firewall]].

==== Outgoing ====
'''Recommended against.''' Port based filtering of outgoing traffic isn't applicable (as in useful) in case of Whonix-Gateway.

Filtering outgoing ports is difficult, since Tor entry guards (or bridges) listen on a variety of different ports. Limiting ports Tor uses for outgoing traffic is possible, although recommended against, since it reduces anonymity (fewer entry guards (or bridges) are available to you). If you want to do so anyway...

On Whonix-Gateway.

Open your {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc&lt;/pre&gt;

Add.

&lt;pre&gt;
ReachableDirAddresses *:80
ReachableORAddresses *:443
## maybe: FirewallPorts PORTS
## See Tor manual: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en
&lt;/pre&gt;

Reload Tor.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service tor reload&lt;/pre&gt;

This has also been discussed [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/3a0b673a/ in the old forum].

= Hardware Security =

It's recommended to use &quot;clean&quot; computers made of parts manufactured by reputable companies and to pay in cash so as to not have hardware IDs leak our identity.

Whonix doesn't do anything against hardware backdoors.

= Physical Attacks =

== Introduction ==

Physical attacks require an adversary to be physically preset, i.e. to be able to touch your computer.

== Full Disk Encryption ==

Note that as said on the warning page, Whonix is not designed as an amnesic operating system.

To protect against theft or robbery, power off your machine at times when this is more likely to happen (traveling) and use FDE (Full Disk Encryption) on the host. When using FDE on the host, you shouldn't keep any unencrypted files on that same physical media. It is advisable to move the /boot partition to separate USB media and install Grub, the bootloader, to it. See [https://twopointfouristan.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/pwning-past-whole-disk-encryption/ Pwning Past Whole Disk Encryption].

Also note, during creation of Whonix, a swap partition gets created and added to /etc/fstab.

== Side channel attacks ==

Whonix does '''not''' defeat [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_keylogger hardware keylogger], miniature cameras, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_%28codename%29 TEMPEST].

Needless to say, that also FDE does not protect against these threats.

== Screen lock ==

Always lock the screen of the host (or better shut down) if you leave the system unattended.

== BIOS password ==

Can't hurt to have BIOS password for BIOS setup and boot. After you are done installing, allow only booting from HDD.

== Cold Boot Attacks ==

Due to how modern computing works, basically everything that you have done during a session is stored in the RAM. If an attacker has physical access to your computer when you are running Whonix, it may enable her to recover everything that have been achieved during the session - even if you are using Full Disk Encryptoion. From typed texts to saved files, including passwords and encryption keys. The more recent the activity, the more likely it is that it is still in the RAM.

Furthermore, it has been shown that the data present in the RAM might be recoverable for seconds or even minutes after the computer is powered off using a cold boot attack.

In both cases the RAM contents can be analyzed in a computer forensics laboratory which might turn into a major disaster depending on what they find.

As far as the authors know, cold boot attacks are not standard procedure within law enforcements and similar organizations anywhere in the world yet, but it might still be good to be prepared and stay on the safe side.

Wipe RAM on shutdown (e.g. using a kexec script) - or do not leave the computer unattended immediately after shutdown. Unfortunately there is not yet an upstream script, to implement wiping the RAM on shutdown. We can not provide a solution for this attack, this is solved nowhere but [https://tails.boum.org/bugs/sdmem_does_not_clear_all_memory/ partially] in Tails and Liberte Linux (not checked), waiting for upstream solution, see [[Dev#SECURITY_Wipe_RAM_panic_script_OPEN_NEEDS_RESEARCH_NEEDS_CODE|Dev#Wipe RAM panic script]]. It's up to you to implement a panic button which will wipe the RAM, please [[Contribute]]. The least you can do is [[Contribute#Vote|Vote]] at upstream for the feature.

'''Hypothetical...''' So, what should you do when you hear an attacker knocking at your door? You could just press the hypothetical panic button on the host. It would start to wipe the contents of the RAM by filling it out with random junk, thus erasing everything that was stored there before, including the encryption key of the encrypted storage devices you might use and the traces of your session. Then you would wait, possibly trying to buy valuable time by barricading your door.

== Problematic Interfaces ==

Some interfaces such as ExpressCard, PCMCIA, FireWire or Thunderbolt may depending on the host operating system settings allow an attacker with physical access to read the RAM. You are advised to securely configure those interfaces, to disable them or to remove them.

== About Debian ==

=== Debian Announcements ===

Since Whonix is based on Debian, it takes advantages of the all of the work done by the Debian security team. As quoted from (http://security.debian.org/):

&lt;pre&gt;Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all security problems brought to our
attention and ensure that they are corrected within a reasonable timeframe. Many
advisories are coordinated with other free software vendors and are published the same
day a vulnerability is made public and we also have a Security Audit team that reviews
the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs. 

Experience has shown that &quot;security through obscurity&quot; does not work. Public disclosure
allows for more rapid and better solutions to security problems. In that vein, this
page addresses Debian's status with respect to various known security holes, which
could potentially affect Debian.&lt;/pre&gt;
Consider also subscribing to the Debian security announcement mailing list.

=== Harden Debian ===

* [http://www.debian.org/security/ Debian Security Information]
* [http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch-automatic-harden.en.html Securing Debian Manual Chapter 6 - Automatic hardening of Debian systems]
* [http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch-automatic-harden.en.html Securing Debian Manual]
* [http://wiki.debian.org/HardeningWalkthrough Hardening Walkthrough]
* Feel free to research even more.

Most hardening steps can not be easily added by default to Whonix. Mostly the user has to understand them and to be aware of them, require knowledge and effort, otherwise one thing or another will break. This is still under investigation and open for suggestions. Having a secure operating system will always be an important topic.

== Harden Software Repositories ==

Many operating systems provide multiple repositories. Since ''Whonix's example implementation'' is based on Debian, you should read [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/ Ubuntu Repositories (similar in Debian)] and [http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html Debian Policy Manual Chapter 2 - The Debian Archive] as introduction.

In conclusion, the main repository gets most attention and security updates. It would make sense to tweak ''/etc/apt/sources.list'' and to only use software from the main repository and to only install security fixes, no other updates.

Whonix currently doesn't do that by default and it's an open question for research if that really improves security.

[https://github.com/fab1an/unix-admin-tools/blob/master/dpkg-origins dpkg-origins] can create a list of all packages and their repository.

== About grsecurity ==

Linux kernel is not a secure OS, Linus himself made it pretty clear that he doesn't think highly of the &quot;security community&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/081408-torvalds-security-circus.html&lt;/ref&gt;. His threat model and a Tor User threat model don't have much in common. Good that Linux is open source and if we disagree with a policy or politics we can just patch or fork it... Grsecurity/PaX is the most comprehensive kernel patch providing much needed security hardening both for the kernel itself and for making userland protections more effective.

Sadly no distribution of binary grsec kernel exists. &lt;ref&gt;There's Alpine Linux but they don't package Tor yet: [http://bugs.alpinelinux.org/issues/1067 Package Request: Tor].&lt;/ref&gt; That means either a packager/maintainer of Whonix needs to compile them EVERY TIME there is a security update to the kernel (which is pretty frequently) or the Whonix users themselves need to compile and update their kernels. This is undesirable because kernel compilation is not set and forget, you need a bit of knowledge, it takes a while, especially in a resource restricted VM and you need to keep updated about new releases via mailing lists or similar because your software updater doesn't automatically handle custom kernels (even emerge in hardened gentoo doesn't). All this would most likely only result in users running old, outdated kernel versions.

Furthermore, for Whonix-Gateway and the Identity/Location TCB grsecurity only addresses a subset of security risks: It can mitigate ''some'' kernel vulnerabilities (and we only really care about the networking stack which is pretty secure judging from its track record). '''Maybe''' '''''some''''' (memory corruption) vulnerabilities in apt-get and Tor that aren't already mitigated by the existing userland hardening done by Ubuntu. It can't protect against backdoors or security issues related to design, policy or yet unknown classes of exploits. We feel that these relatively small advantages outweigh the issues introduced by using a custom compiled kernel. We hope a binary distro will step forward and start using grsecurity. In that case we'll most likely switch Whonix-Gateway to that distro as soon as possible.

For Whonix-Workstation the benefits are even more doubtful. To be effective grsecurity needs to lock down some functions that are needed by Xorg, JIT compilers... but we need those to be working. To solve this we'd have to write a restrictive RBAC policy which is far from trivial. We think accepting that Whonix-Workstation will be exploitable and acting accordingly (using snapshots and rolling back to clean state) is the right approach for a desktop system.

If you disagree with this assessment or have any suggestions how to improve the current situation please let us know.

Experts only: There is also Hardened Gentoo based Whonix-Gateway. Outdated, needs maintainer. See [[Hardened Gentoo TG]].

= Virtualization Platform =

== About VirtualBox ==

VirtualBox is developed by Oracle, a company which is known for not being very &quot;open&quot;. That includes how they announce security issues in their products as well as how they are perceived by the security community and how they will communicate with each other.

VirtualBox is primarily a simple, &quot;user friendly&quot;, desktop solution and most certainly not designed with our threat model in mind. I haven't heard of anyone seriously auditing the code and I'd like to recommend a different VM solution at least as an alternative. There's KVM and Xen, open source but not cross-platform. It seems they are still lacking in terms of a reliable &quot;internal networking&quot; feature which Whonix heavily depends on. (If you know more, please edit this paragraph).

Anyone looking into Whonix solely because of security should really consider using Whonix with [[Physical Isolation]].

== Qubes OS ==

It shouldn't be very hard to get Whonix to run on top of Qubes OS, which would be more secure than VirtualBox. See blog post: [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/featureblog/2013/02/running-whonix-on-top-of-qubes-os-anyone-interested-unpacking-ova-images/ Running Whonix on top of Qubes OS, anyone interested?].

== Secure Label ==

[http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#idp12297856 Secure labeling with VBoxSDL] has not yet been added to Whonix. I couldn't get it to work. If you know more, please share your knowledge.

We must not end up with non-standard desktop resolution, as per [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].

= Whonix-Workstation Security =

== Hardening ==
=== Introduction ===
Whonix isn't a perfectly hardened system. Additional hardening would be very welcome. At the same time, hardening by default is very difficult. That's why this is outside the scope of the Whonix Anonymous Operating System project, unless the project gets serious amounts of help with it. Hardening is left to the upstream operating system. See [[Dev/Operating System]] for details.

=== AppArmor ===
Learn about [http://wiki.apparmor.net AppArmor]. Check out Whonix's [[AppArmor]] profiles.

== More than one Tor Browser in Whonix ==
These instructions only work with TBB 3.x and above.

As the [[Warning]] page stated, [[Warning#Whonix_doesn.27t_magically_separate_your_different_contextual_identities | Whonix doesn't magically separate your different contextual identities]] and since Tor Browser and Tor Button do not yet solve this, for further separation of identities you could use [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]], which would be more secure.

Alternatively, less secure than Multiple Whonix-Workstations, you could start multiple instances of Tor Browser and run them through different SocksPorts. The instructions in the [[Manually Updating Tor Browser]] article need minimal changes.

You need to extract Tor Browser into a different folder.

You also have to use a different SocksPort, see [[Tor_Browser#Change.2FRemove_Proxy_Settings|Change/Remove Proxy Settings]]. (See [[Stream Isolation]] page for explanation why you should use different SocksPorts.)

== Using multiple Whonix-Workstations ==

See [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].

== Second, Optional, Extra Firewall ==
There is a Second, Optional, Extra Firewall for Whonix-Workstation, which is disabled by default. You find it inside Whonix-Workstation in {{WhonixFirewall}}.

Read the script comments and decide if you want to use it.

= Whonix-Gateway Security =

== Static VirtualBox IP ==

Instead of using DHCP to obtain the internal IP for Whonix-Workstation eth0 NAT adapter, you could also use a static IP instead. Perhaps this could (minimally?) improve security, since you can remove one more package: the DHCP package.

Open ''/etc/network/interfaces'' [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/stable/whonix_gateway/etc/network/interfaces on github], read the comments, comment out DHCP and comment in Static VirtualBox IP.

= Chaining Anonymizing Gateways =

Experts only!

All Whonix-Workstation traffic is by default forced through Whonix-Gateway. Alternatively, you could also build a chain of Anonymizing Gateways. Examples:

Post-Tor-VPN.

&lt;pre&gt;
## chain:
Whonix-Workstation -&gt; VPN-Gateway    -&gt; Whonix-Gateway -&gt; clearnet
## connection scheme:
user               -&gt; Tor            -&gt; VPN            -&gt; destination server
&lt;/pre&gt;

Post-Tor-VPN.

&lt;pre&gt;
## chain:
Whonix-Workstation -&gt; Whonix-Gateway -&gt; VPN-Gateway    -&gt; clearnet
## connection scheme:
user               -&gt; VPN            -&gt; Tor            -&gt; destination server
&lt;/pre&gt;

Pre- and Post-Tor-VPN.

&lt;pre&gt;
## chain:
Whonix-Workstation -&gt; VPN-Gateway    -&gt; Whonix-Gateway -&gt; VPN-Gateway -&gt; destination server
## connection scheme:
user               -&gt; VPN            -&gt; Tor            -&gt; VPN         -&gt; destination server
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's not limited to VPN-Gateways. You could also replace the VPN with a Proxy-Gateway.

Post-Tor-Proxy.

&lt;pre&gt;
## chain:
Whonix-Workstation -&gt; Proxy-Gateway  -&gt; Whonix-Gateway -&gt; clearnet
## connection scheme:
user               -&gt; Tor            -&gt; Proxy          -&gt; destination server
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or with a Post-Tor-Proxy, or with a Pre/Post-Tor-SSH. Or replace the proxy with JonDo or perhaps i2p. Virtually any combinations are possible.

It's important to understand, that the connection will be created in reverse order. This is best explained using an example.

&lt;pre&gt;
## chain:
Whonix-Workstation -&gt; Proxy-Gateway  -&gt; Whonix-Gateway -&gt; VPN-Gateway -&gt; clearnet
## connection scheme:
user               -&gt; VPN            -&gt; Tor            -&gt; Proxy       -&gt; destination server
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you think about it, it becomes clear why the connection happens in reverse order. Whonix-Workstation has no way but to go through the Proxy-Gateway. The Proxy-Gateway has no way but to go through Whonix-Gateway. The last one in the chain, in this case, the VPN-Gateway, must obviously connect through clearnet. Thus, the VPN-Gateway uses clearnet, the Whonix-Gateway uses the VPN-Gateway to connect, the Proxy-Gateway uses Whonix-Gateway to connect and Whonix-Workstation uses the Proxy-Gateway to connect. Since the Proxy-Gateway has no way but to go through Whonix-Gateway followed by VPN-Gateway, it's clear why it will be the last hop in front of the destination server.

Whether such combinations make sense or not is controversially discussed and depends on your personal threat model, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor plus VPN or Proxy].

Legend:

* destination server: could be for example a website

Recommended basic knowledge:

* [[Tunnel_Proxy_or_SSH_or_VPN_through_Tor]]
* [[Tunnel_Tor_through_proxy_or_VPN_or_SSH]]
* [[Stream Isolation]]

May be useful as well: [[Dev/Inspiration]].

You must know, understand and edit /etc/network/interfaces on Whonix-Gateway and/or on Whonix-Workstation (and if not using physical isolation, the virtual internal network name in VirtualBox settings).

It will be difficult, because there are no other Anonymizing Gateways (VPN/JonDo/i2p/Proxy/SSH/VPN) available for download besides Whonix-Gateway which uses Tor to anonymize traffic, which you already know about. You have to look for instructions (there are some for a pfSense based VPN-Gateway you can find using a search engine, but untested for leaks, which does not imply, that there are leaks) and/or build such a Anonymizing-Gateway yourself.

|description=Security Advice After Installing Whonix
}}

== On Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation ==

=== Change Passwords ===

'''The default username is:''' '''''user'''''

'''The default password is:''' '''''changeme'''''

Immediately change it!

Login as root:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo su&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;references/&gt;

Change root and user password:

&lt;pre&gt;
passwd
passwd user
&lt;/pre&gt;

and follow the instructions.

=== Security Updates ===

Regularly check for '''security updates''' and apply them. See [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_install_latest_security_updates_on_all_systems]].

== Network Time Syncing ==
Don't wonder... To prevent against time zone leaks, the system clock inside Whonix was set to UTC. This means it may be a few hours before or ahead of your host system clock. Do not change!

When you use the pause/suspend/save/resume feature of VirtualBox or the hibernate feature of your host operating system, while Whonix-Workstation was running, you should manually run TimeSync afterwards!&lt;ref&gt;This is because the clock will be incorrect after resume. A correct clock is important for anonymity (See [[Dev/TimeSync]] if you want to know why.)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Start Menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Whonix TimeSync
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's recommended against to pause/suspend/save/hibernate the Whonix-Gateway, because it'll be difficult to restore the clock after resume.

If your host clock is more than 1 hour in the past or more than 3 hours in the future, Tor can't connect. In this case fix your host clock manually (right click on clock). (Check for empty battery.) Then power off Whonix-Gateway and power it back up again. Tor should be able to connect after that. If your host clock is even more off, you could get into trouble updating your host operating system, so keep an eye on it and make sure that it's somewhat accurate.

This chapter is supposed to be as simple and short as possible to provide basic protection. You can achieve more security if you understand the [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Network_Time_Synchronization | Network Time Synchronization]] chapter from the Advanced Security Guide.

== Security Guide ==

You can further improve the security, see the [[Security Guide]].

= Things NOT to do =

== I wonder what my site looks like when I'm anonymous. ==

&quot;I wonder what my site looks like when I'm anonymous&quot; &lt;ref&gt;https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2012-April/003472.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It's best not to visit your own personal website where either real names or pseudonyms (which have ever been tied to a non-Tor connection/IP) are attached. Because how many people are visiting your personal website? 90% of all Tor users, or just you, or just very few other people? That's weak anonymity. Once you visit a website your Tor circuit gets dirty. The exit relay knows that someone visited your website and if the site is not that popular, it's a good guess that 'someone' was you. It wouldn't be hard to assume that further connections originating from that exit relay come from your machine.

Source: &lt;ref&gt;[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3455 Tor Browser should set SOCKS username for a request based on referer]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Login into your real life Facebook account and think you are anonymous. ==

Don't login into your personal Facebook account. No matter if your real name is attached or only a pseudonym. You most likely added your friends and they know who the account belongs to. Through your social network Facebook can guess who you are.

No anonymity solution is magic. Online anonymity software may reliable hide your IP/location. But Facebook does not need your IP/location. They already know who you are, who your friends are, which private messages you send and so on. All those data is at least stored on Facebook server. No kind of software can delete that data. Only Facebook and crackers could.

So if you log into your personal Facebook account you only get location privacy. No anonymity.

Quoted from &quot;To Toggle, or not to Toggle: The End of Torbutton&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/toggle-or-not-toggle-end-torbutton The Tor Blog&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
mike, am i completely anonymized if i log onto my facebook account? im using firefox 3.6 with tor and no script on windows 7 machine. thank you.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Never login into accounts you ever used without Tor. ==
Always assume that each time you visit a website, that they will log the IP/location which visited the website, at which time and what you did.

Also assume, that each time you're online your ISP (Internet Service Provider) will log your online time, IP/location and perhaps traffic. Your ISP could also log to which IPs/locations you connected, how much traffic and what you send and retrieved. (Unless it's encrypted, then they'll see only garbage.) The following tables should give you an simplified overview how those logs could look like.

ISP Log:

You'll see, when websites and ISP keep logs, no one needs Sherlock Holmes to conclude.

If you mess up for one time, and login with a non-Tor connection/IP, which can be tied to you, then the whole account is compromised.

== Don't login into your bank account, paypal, ebay or other important personal accounts unless... ==

Logging into your bank, paypal, ebay or other important personal accounts registered on your name where money is involved could risk, that your account gets suspended, due to &quot;suspicious activity&quot; by the fraud prevention system. This is because crackers sometimes use Tor for committing fraud. That's probably not what you want.

It's not anonymous for reasons already explained. It's pseudonymous and offers circumvention (in case access to the site is blocked by your ISP) and location privacy. The difference of anonymity and pseudonymity is covered in a later chapter on this page.

In many cases you will be able to contact the support and to get your account unblocked again or on request, even the fraud protection policy gets relaxed for your account.

Whonix developer adrelanos is not against using Tor for circumvention and/or location privacy, you just should know the risk of your account getting (temporarily) suspended and the other things mentioned on this page and the other warnings from the Whonix documentation. So if you know what you are doing, feel free.

== Don't alternate Tor with open WiFi. ==

You may think open WiFi is faster and equally safe as Tor since the IP/location cannot be tied to your real name, right?

It's better to use an open WiFi ''AND'' Tor, but not an open WiFi ''OR'' Tor.

The approximate location of any IP address can be tied down to a city, region or even a street. Even if you are away, you still gave away your city or approximate location since most people don't switch continents.

While this doesn't break your anonymity, the circle of suspect has decreased from the entire world, a continent, or the country to a region. This strongly hurts your anonymity. Keep as much information as possible to yourself.

== Prevent Tor over Tor scenarios. ==

'''Whonix specific.'''

When using a transparent proxy (Whonix includes one), it is possible to start a Tor session from the client as well as from the transparent proxy, creating a &quot;Tor over Tor&quot; scenario.

This happens when installing Tor inside Whonix-Workstation or when using the Tor Browser Bundle without configuring it to use a SocksPort instead of the TransPort. (Covered in the [[Tor Browser]] article.)

Doing so produces undefined and potentially unsafe behavior. In theory, however, you can get six hops instead of three, but it is not guaranteed that you'll get three different hops - you could end up with the same hops, maybe in reverse or mixed order. It is not clear if this is safe. It has never been discussed.

You can choose an entry/exit point &lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#ChooseEntryExit&lt;/ref&gt;, but you get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor; overriding the entry / exit relays can mess up your anonymity in ways we don't understand. Therefore Tor over Tor usage is highly discouraged.

== Don't send sensitive data without end-to-end encryption. ==

As already explained on the [[Warning]] page, Tor exit relays can eavesdrop on communications and other Man-in-the-middle attacks can happen. The only way to get sensitive data from the sender to the recipient while withholding it from third parties, is using end-to-end encryption.

== Don't disclose identifying data about yourself. ==

Deanonymsation is not only possible with connections/IP addresses but by social threats too. Some recommendations to avoid deanonymisation collected by Anonymous:

* Do not include personal informations in your nickname
* Do not discuss personal informations, where you are from...
* Do not mention your gender, tattos, piercings or physical capacities.
* Do not mention your profession, hobbies or involvement in activist groups.
* Do not use special characters on keyboard, which are existent only in your language.
* Do not post informations to the regular internet while you are anonymous. Do not use Twitter and Facebook. This is easy to correlate.
* Do not post links to facebook images. The image name contains a personal ID.
* Do not connect to same destination at the same time. Try to alternate.
* IRC, other chats, forum, mailing list, etc. are public, keep that in mind.
* Heroes only exist in comic books keep that in mind! There are only young heroes and dead heroes.

If it's a must to disclose identifying data about yourself, treat it as &quot;sensitive data&quot; in the point above.

== Do use bridges if you think Tor usage is dangerous/suspicious in your country. ==

Quoted from the [[Bridges]] page: &quot;''Bridges are important tools that work in many cases but they are '''not an absolute protection''' against the technical progress that an adversary could do to identify Tor users.''&quot;

== Don't use different online identities at the same time. ==

They easily correlate. [[Warning#Whonix_doesn.27t_magically_separate_your_different_contextual_identities | Whonix doesn't magically separate your different contextual identities]].

Also read the points below.

== Don't log into Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. longer than necessary. ==

Restrict the time your are logged in accounts for Twitter, Facebook, Google and any other account based services (web forum etc.) to the time you are using them. After you are done with reading, posting and so on, log out. At least log out, shut down Tor Browser, change your Tor circuit using a [[Tor Controller]], wait a few seconds until the circuit changed, restart Tor Browser. For better security follow the [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots |  Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots]] and/or to [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations |  use multiple Whonix-Workstations]].

This is because many websites include one or more of the many integration buttons, such as &quot;I like&quot; and &quot;twitter this&quot; and Google analytics, adsense etc. Those buttons tell the originating service that you visited that website because you were still logged into their service.

Also note the chapter &quot;Don't use different online identities at the same time.&quot; above.

== Do not mix Modes of Anonymity! ==

Let us begin with an overview of the different Modes of Anonymity:

=== mode(1): user anonymous; any recipient ===

* Scenario: post anonymously a message in a message board/mailing list/comment field
* Scenario: whistleblower and such
* You are anonymous.
* Your real IP/location stays hidden.
* Location privacy: your location remains secret.

=== mode(2): user knows recipient; both use Tor ===

* Scenario: both sender and recipient know each other and both use Tor.
* They can communicate with each other without any third party being wise to their activity or even to the knowledge that they are communicating with each other.
* You are NOT anonymous.
* Your real IP/location stays hidden.
* Location privacy: your location remains secret.

=== mode(3): user with no anonymity using Tor; any recipient ===

* Scenario: login with your real name into any services, such as webmail, Twitter, Facebook, etc...
* You are obviously NOT anonymous. As soon as you log into an account where you entered your real name the website knows your identity. Tor can not make you anonymous in these situations.
* Your real IP/location stays hidden.
* Location privacy. Your location remains secret.

=== mode(4): user with no anonymity; any recipient ===

* Scenario: normal browsing without Tor.
* You are NOT anonymous.
* Your real IP/location gets revealed.
* Your location gets revealed.

=== Conclusion ===

It's not wise to combine mode(1) and mode(2). For example, if you have an IM or email account and use that via mode(1), you are advised not to use the same account for mode(2). We have explained previously why this is an issue.

'''It's also not wise to mix two or more modes inside the same Tor session''', as they could share the same exit relay (identity correlation).

It's also possible that other combinations of modes are dangerous and could lead to the leakage of personal information or your physical location.

== Don't change settings if you don't know their consequences. ==
Changing user interface settings for applications, which do not connect to the internet, mostly safe. For example, checking a box &quot;don't show this tip of the day anymore&quot; or &quot;hide this menu bar&quot; will have no effect on anonymity.

Look into the Whonix documentation, if changing the settings you are interested in, is documented or recommended against; try to live with the defaults.

Changing settings for applications, which connect to the internet, even user interface settings, has to be thoroughly reviewed. For example removing a menu bar or using Full Screen in Tor Browser is recommended against. The latter is known to modify the screen size, which is bad for the web fingerprint.

You should only modify network settings with great care if you know their consequences. For example, you should stay away from the advice related to &quot;Firefox Tuning&quot;. If you believe the settings are suboptimal, the changes should be proposed upstream, so they get changed for all Tor Browser users with the next release.

== Do not use clearnet and Tor at the same time. ==

Using your non-Tor browser and Tor Browser at the same time, risks that you at some point confuse one for the other and deanonymize yourself.

Using clearnet and Tor at the same time also risks that you connect to a server anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time, which is recommended against. The reason for this is explained in the point below. You never know when you visit the same page anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time, because you only see the url you're visiting, not how many resources are fetched in background. Many different websites are hosted in the same cloud. Services such as google analytics are on the majority of all websites and therefore see a lot anonymous and non-anonymous connections.

If you really want not to follow this recommendation, use at least two different desktops to prevent confusing one browser for another.

== Do not connect to any server anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time! ==

It's highly recommended that you do not connect to any remote server in this manner. That is, do not create a Tor link and a non-Tor link to the same remote server at the same time. In the event your internet connection breaks down (and it will eventually), all your connections will break at the same time and it won't be hard for an adversary to put the pieces together and determine what public IP/location belongs to what Tor IP/connection, potentially identifying you directly.

License of &quot;Do not connect to any server anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time!&quot;: &lt;ref name=adrelicense /&gt;

== Do not confuse Anonymity with Pseudonymity. ==

This chapter explains the difference between anonymity and pseudonymity. Word definitions are always a difficult topic because a majority of people has to agree with it.

An anonymous connection is defined as a connection to a destination server, where the destination server has no means to find out the origin (IP/location) of that connection nor to associate and an identifier &lt;ref name=identifier&gt;An identifier could be for example a (Flash) Cookie with an unique number.&lt;/ref&gt; to it.

A pseudonymous connection is defined as a connection to a destination server, where the destination server has no means to find out the origin (IP/location) of a connection, but can associate it with an identifier &lt;ref name=identifier /&gt;.

In an ideal world, the Tor network, Tor Browser (and the underlying operating system, hardware, physical security, etc.) is perfect. For example the user could fetch a news website and neither the news website nor the website's ISP has any idea if that user has ever contacted the news website before. &lt;ref&gt;Fingerprinting defense isn't perfect yet in any browser. There are still open bugs. See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=needs_information&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=keywords&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;keywords=tbb-linkability tbb-linkability] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=needs_revision&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=keywords&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;keywords=tbb-fingerprinting tbb-fingerprinting].&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of this, when using software incorrectly, for example using Firefox instead of the Tor-safe browser Tor Browser, the original (IP/location) of a connection is still hidden, but an identifier (for example Cookies) can be used to make that connection pseudonymous. The destination website could log for example &quot;user with id 111222333444 viewed video title a at time b on date c, video title d at time e at date f.&quot;. These information can be used for profiling. Over time these profiles become more and more comprehensive, which reduces anonymity, i.e. in worst case it could lead to de-anonymization.

As soon as someone logs into a website (for example into a forum or e-mail address) with a username the connection is by definition no longer anonymous, but pseudonymous. The origin of the connection (IP/location) is still hidden, but the connection can be associated with an identifier &lt;ref name=identifier /&gt;, i.e. in this case, an account name. Identifiers can be used to keep a log of various things. When a user wrote what, date and time of login and logout, what a user wrote, to whom the user wrote, IP address (useless, if it's a Tor exit relay), browser fingerprint etc.

Maxim Kammerer, developer of Liberté Linux &lt;ref&gt;http://dee.su/liberte&lt;/ref&gt;, has a interesting different opinion. &lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.dee.su/topic/anon-test-for-ll-on-ipcheck-info#65650000000264003 Quote] [http://www.webcitation.org/6EEeh3pNp (w)]&lt;/ref&gt; I don't want to withhold from you:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not seen a compelling argument for anonymity, as opposed to pseudonymity. Enlarging anonymity sets is something that Tor developers do in order to publish incremental papers and justify funding. Most users only need to be pseudonymous, where their location is hidden. Having a unique browser does not magically uncover user's location, if that user does not use that browser for non-pseudonymous activities. Having good browser header results on anonymity checkers equally does not mean much, because there are many ways to uncover more client details (e.g., via Javascript oddities).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Don't be the first one to spread your own link. ==

You created an anonymous blog or hidden service? Great. You have a twitter account with lots of followers, run a big clearnet news page or similar? Great. Do not be tempted to be one of the first ones to advertise your new anonymous project! The more you separate identities, the better. Of course, at some point you may or even must be &quot;naturally&quot; aware of it, but be very careful at this point.

== Don't open random files or links. ==

Someone sent you an pdf by mail or gave you a link to a pdf? That sender/mailbox/account/key could be compromised and the pdf could be prepared to infect your system. Don't open it with the default tool you were expected use with by the creator. For example, don't open a pdf with a pdf viewer. If the content is public anyway, try using a free online pdf viewer.

== Don't do (mobile) phone verification. ==

Websites such as Google, Facebook and others will ask for a (mobile) phone number if you login over Tor. Unless you are really clever or have an alternative, you shouldn't do it.

Reason: The number you give away will be logged. The SIM card is most likely registered on your name. And even if not, receiving an SMS gives away your location. Even if you anonymously bought a SIM card and do it from a point far away from your home, there is still a risk: the phone itself. Each time the phone logs into the mobile network, the provider will log the SIM card serial number &lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity IMSI]
&lt;/ref&gt; AND the phone serial number &lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Station_Equipment_Identity IMEI]&lt;/ref&gt;. If you bought the SIM card anonymously, but not the phone, it's not anonymous, because these two serials will get linked. If you really want to do mobile verification, you need a spot far away from your home, a fresh phone, and a fresh SIM card. Afterwards, you must turn off the phone, and burn both the phone and the SIM card right after doing it.

You could try to find an online service receiving SMS for you. That would work and would be anonymous. The problem is, that it most likely won't work for Google and Facebook, because they actively blacklist such numbers for verification. Or you could try to find someone else receiving the SMS for you, but that would only shift the risk from you to the other person.

== Why this page? ==

You can skip &quot;''Why this page?''&quot;.

This page highly risks to state obvious things. Obvious to whom? Developers, hackers, geeks, etc. may call that common sense.

Those groups tend to lose contact to actual non-techy users. It's good sometimes to read usability papers or feedback from people who do not post on mailing lists or in forums.

For example:

* Quoted from &quot;To Toggle, or not to Toggle: The End of Torbutton&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/toggle-or-not-toggle-end-torbutton The Tor Blog&lt;/ref&gt;:

|description=Protection from IP Leaks, DNS Leaks, Protocol Leaks and Fingerprinting.
}}

== Introduction ==
Whonix can not do the impossible and magically prevent all kinds of [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Protocolleaks protocol leaks]. However, it does offer best possible protection. It is a multi level protection always trying to prevent the worst.

== Most dangerous leaks are protected ==
Most dangerous leaks are protected. The following ones are in the most dangerous categorical, because they would lead remotely and directly to the users real identity.

* Your real external non-Tor IP address is covered due to the whole Whonix design, isolated proxy usage and [[Install_Software#Whonix-Workstation_is_firewalled|the Whonix firewall]]. &lt;ref name=one&gt;
This does not cover application vulnerabilities and exploits, which escalate from the virtual machine to the host see [[Comparison_with_Others#Attacks|Attacks]]. However, by design, the Whonix-Workstation does not know its own external non-Tor IP address.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* The same as above goes for DNS&lt;ref name=one /&gt; requests, they are safe. &lt;ref&gt;
''/etc/resolv.conf'' in Whonix-Workstation is configured to use the Whonix-Gateway as DNS resolver, which is routed through Tor.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Many Whonix default applications are already configured, not to leak ==
* Configured to use their own SocksPort ([[Stream Isolation]]), thus preventing Identity correlation through circuit sharing.
* Browser fingerprinting: ''Whonix Example Implementation'' [[Tor Browser|includes Tor Browser]]. The browser fingerprint is as good/as bad, as if you were using the normal Tor Browser Bundle from torproject.org.
* GPG: /home/user/gpg.conf is optimized for privacy [https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/pull/11 recommended] as per [https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/blob/master/gpg.conf torbirdy github repository] not to leak your operating system version (no-emit-version) and other stuff ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/stable/whonix_workstation/home/user/.gnupg/gpg.conf on github]).
* XChat: uses secure defaults as per [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat TorifyHOWTO/XChat] ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/stable/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/xchat2 on github]). Identity can be reset using ''xchat-reset'' ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/stable/whonix_workstation/usr/local/bin/xchat-reset on github]) as documented on the [[XChat]] page.
* ssh: Without Whonix, syntax for ssh is user@hostname [...], but if the user forgets to specific user before @hostname, the operating system user name will be used and if that is something identifiable, anonymity is broken. Since Whonix set the user name to ''user'', in worst case, only the username ''user'' can be leaked, which is harmless. He could just have copied the syntax from the manpage. In another, similar project, Tails, the username is set to amnesia, which is also not something the user entered and therefore safe.

Many protocol leaks are documented [[Documentation]] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO TorifyHOWTO].

== Important identifiers ==

These are also important identifiers, because they can be used for fingerprinting, narrow down the list of suspects (for example, the time zone) or even lead to directly to deanonymization (for example, if username were set to John Doe).

* Desktop resolution is 1024x768 for all Whonix users. (Virtual) refresh rate is set to 60. &lt;ref&gt;
You can check the desktop resolution and refresh rate by running in console: 

&lt;pre&gt;xrandr&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=fontlist&gt;
Note that you can not rely on https://ip-check.info or similar websites for checking desktop resolution and color depth, because Tor Button changes this values to improve your anonymity. See Tor Button specification and Tor trac for details. You can check installed fonts using: 

&lt;pre&gt;fc-list&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Color depth is the default 24 bit for all Whonix users. &lt;ref&gt;
You can check color depth by running in console: 

&lt;pre&gt;xdpyinfo | grep &quot;of root&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=fontlist /&gt;
* All Whonix users have the same list of fonts installed. &lt;ref&gt;
As long you or any additional software packages do not install further packages.
&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;
Only 3 common fonts (monospace, serif, times new roman) for all Tor Browser / TBB users can be detected. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;
Robert Ransom suggested, if possible, to share the same list of fonts as Tails. Since Tor Browser does not leak, which fonts are installed anymore Whonix developer adrelanos fails to see the advantage of this. Follow-up inquiry ignored.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Internal (virtual LAN) IP address is the same for all Whonix users.&lt;ref&gt;
You can check your internal (virtual LAN) IP address using: 

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ifconfig&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Time
** Whonix-Workstation, Whonix-Gateway and the host time are all different from each other.
** Time zone (local time) is set to UTC. &lt;ref&gt;
You can check your time zone using: 

&lt;pre&gt;cat /etc/timezone&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
** Hardware clock is set to UTC.
** See [[TimeSync|Whonix's Time Synchronization Mechanism]] for more information.
* User name is set to user.
* Hostname is set to host. &lt;ref&gt;You can check that by running.

&lt;pre&gt;
host
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Long host name (FQDN) is set to host.localdomain. &lt;ref&gt;You can check that by running.
&lt;pre&gt;
hostname --fqdn
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operating system (apt-get) updates are routed through their own circuit ([[Stream Isolation]]) to prevent accidentally leakage of your software packages and versions (if any custom software installed) which then could be correlated with other anonymous activity. See also [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Softwareupdaters Software updaters] and [[Install Software | Software installation Whonix-Workstation]].
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address MAC address] is different from the host &lt;ref&gt;
You can check Whonix-Workstations MAC address using 

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ifconfig | grep HWaddr&lt;/pre&gt;

inside Whonix-Workstation and then comparing with your host.
&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;
Disadvantages of shared MAC Addresses:

* [[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations]] can not use the internet at the same time if they are using the same MAC address. It leads to confusing connection interruptions in the one or the other virtual machine.
* The advantage of sharing MAC addresses among all Whonix versions are very little. (That would be useful, in case an application leaks the MAC address or in case Whonix-Workstation got compromised.
* The project maintainers have to explain and defend the design, which takes a lot time of such little gain. (Again, it's important not to expose the hosts, the real MAC address, but as long as the one inside the virtual machine is different, everything is in an acceptable state.)
&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;
Advantages of shared MAC addresses:

* It may be easier to develop [[Connections_between_Whonix-Gateway_and_Whonix-Workstation#ARP_spoofing_defense|ARP spoofing defense]] to implement authenticated connections between Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. (Only useful when using [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].) To understand the context, please read [[Connections_between_Whonix-Gateway_and_Whonix-Workstation]].
* There are cases, were some applications gather your MAC address and send it to a remote server (proprietary license checks use the MAC for hardware fingerprinting) and we might be better off with a shared one then?
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Worst case scenario: contents of your RAM (error reporting software phoning home; RAM dump if infected with malware; [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks]) would &quot;only&quot; contain the RAM of your Whonix-Workstation. All your non-anonymous stuff on your Host would stay safe.

== Metadata ==

See [[Metadata]].

== Less important identifiers ==

These identifiers are less important, because an adversary can only collect them, either if the user installed malicious software (for example, some copyright enforcement and anticheat tools collect them) or only if the adversary got remote access, i.e. the adversary has compromised a user or in some cases the root account.

Implemented:

* Hardware serial numbers which any applications could collect are hidden due to the Virtual Machine.&lt;ref&gt;
You can check the visible hardware yourself with 

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lshw
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;sudo lshw&lt;/pre&gt;

and 

&lt;pre&gt;sudo lspci&lt;/pre&gt;

If you have USB devices attached use: 

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install usbutils
sudo lsusb
&lt;/pre&gt;

and then comparing with your host.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* CPU model and capabilities are hidden by VirtualBox &quot;Synthetic CPU&quot; option.
** Unfortunately, the clock speed of your host CPU is visible to all code (applications or malware) inside Whonix-Workstation.&lt;ref&gt;
This is due to the design of virtualization platforms (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.). Most virtualization platforms leak CPU model, capabilities and clock speed. VirtualBox (4.1+ if not earlier) can mask at least the model and capabilities of the CPU with the &quot;Synthetic CPU&quot; option. This option is activated by default on Whonix 0.2.1 and above. Check 

&lt;pre&gt;cat /proc/cpuinfo&lt;/pre&gt;

If that is a still problem for you another workaround could be to use an emulator, such as [http://bochs.sourceforge.net/ bochs] or qemu. Unfortunately such emulators are slow and there might be other limitations. (Does Bochs support internal networking?)
&lt;/ref&gt;
* RAM is set to 768 MB.
* Sensor information (cpu temperature, hdd temperature, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T. S.M.A.R.T.]) are hidden. &lt;ref&gt;
You can check the sensor information using: 

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install hddtemp

sudo hddtemp /dev/sda
&lt;/pre&gt;

 and 

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install lm-sensors
sudo sensors-detect&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately VirtualBox does hide them from the guest Virtual Machine by not implementing them.
* Battery information is unfortunately not hidden by VirtualBox. &lt;ref&gt;
You can check the battery information using: 

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install acpi

acpi -V
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* BIOS DMI information is hidden by VirtualBox. &lt;ref name=biosdmi&gt;
You can check the BIOS DMI information using: 

&lt;pre&gt;sudo dmidecode&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Virtual BIOS DMI information and Virtual HDD and CD serial numbers are implemented by VirtualBox. &lt;ref name=biosdmi /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;
You can disk ids using: 

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ls -la /dev/disk/by-id/&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* VM UUID, as in explained in [http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html#vboxmanage-modifyvdi VBoxManage modifyhd] has no relation to your host by default. &lt;ref&gt;
You can check the VM UUID using:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo dmidecode&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh673514.aspx SLIC table] is empty by default inside VirtualBox. &lt;ref&gt;
You can check the SILC table using: 

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo cat /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/SLIC
&lt;/pre&gt;

inside VirtualBox and on your host. On your host there may or may be not be a SLIC table. If there is none, it can't leak into VirtualBox. If there is one, you'll see, that it's not mirrored in VirtualBox, which is fine.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* HDD UUIDs are different from your host. &lt;ref&gt;
You can check the HDD UUID using: 

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo hdparm -i /dev/sda
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* CD-ROM UUID is the same for all Whonix users. &lt;ref&gt;
You can check the CD-ROM UUID using: 

&lt;pre&gt;
udisks --show-info /dev/cdrom
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* All Whonix users have by default the same set of software packages installed. - If you install software packages yourself, you give up that advantage. See also [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Softwareupdaters Software updaters].
* Disk uuids of the real hardware are hidden through VirtualBox.
* Related VirtualBox tickets:

** [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10975 document which information from the host are visible to VMs]

|description=Help Testing Whonix
}}

= Troubleshooting =
See [[Troubleshooting]].

= Advanced users / developers and testers only =

== On Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation ==
=== Misc ===
Check if there are any DENIED messages from AppArmor inside /var/log/syslog.

&lt;pre&gt;cat /var/log/syslog | grep DENIED&lt;/pre&gt;

Install dpkg-dev, which is required for dpkg-vendor.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends dpkg-dev&lt;/pre&gt;

Run {{Code2|dpkg-vendor --query vendor}}.

&lt;pre&gt;dpkg-vendor --query vendor&lt;/pre&gt;

The output must be &quot;Whonix&quot;.

Check apt config and see if periodic updates are disabled.

&lt;pre&gt;apt-config dump&lt;/pre&gt;

Install test wise new kernel.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

Remove test wise linux-image-486 kernel.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get remove linux-image-486&lt;/pre&gt;

Check content of {{Code2|/etc/network/interfaces}}.

&lt;pre&gt;cat /etc/network/interfaces&lt;/pre&gt;

Check content of {{Code2|/etc/resolv.conf}}.

&lt;pre&gt;cat /etc/resolv.conf&lt;/pre&gt;

Check {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list}}.

&lt;pre&gt;cat /etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/pre&gt;

Check iptables.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo iptables --list | more&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Extra ===
Check if aptitude is functional.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo aptitude update&lt;/pre&gt;

Check if /var/run/bootclockrandomization/success exists.

&lt;pre&gt;ls -la /var/run/bootclockrandomization/success&lt;/pre&gt;

Check boot clock randomization log.

&lt;pre&gt;cat /var/log/bootclockrandomization.log

sudo service bootclockrandomization status

echo $?&lt;/pre&gt;

Check if /var/run/timesanitycheck/success exists.

&lt;pre&gt;ls -la /var/run/timesanitycheck/success&lt;/pre&gt;

Check log of time sanity check.

&lt;pre&gt;cat /var/log/timesanitycheck.log&lt;/pre&gt;

Check status of time sanity check.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service timesanitycheck status

echo $?
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check if /var/run/htpdate/success exists

&lt;pre&gt;ls -la /var/run/htpdate/success&lt;/pre&gt;

Check log of htpdate.

&lt;pre&gt;cat /var/log/htpdate.log&lt;/pre&gt;

Check status of htpdate.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service htpdate status

echo $?
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== sdwdate / timesync ===
Create a file which will result in sdwdate failing, thus timesync should report an test error.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo touch /var/lib/whonix/sdw_error
&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart sdwdate.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service sdwdate restart
&lt;/pre&gt;

Delete test file.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo rm /var/lib/whonix/sdw_error
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== kdm ===
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service kdm stop
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service kdm start
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Test on Whonix-Gateway ==
Check Tor version.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo tor --version&lt;/pre&gt;

Check obfsproxy version. Must include obfs3.

&lt;pre&gt;obfsproxy -h&lt;/pre&gt;

Check the logs.

&lt;pre&gt;less /var/log/tor/log&lt;/pre&gt;

Test if arm is fully functional.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo arm&lt;/pre&gt;

Test if arm's new identity function is working.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

After logging in you should see Whonix help/welcome/disclaimer message.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

Test connecting to an obfsproxy bridge. Check /var/log/syslog for AppArmor error messages.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

== Test Whonix-Workstation ==

=== Basics ===

Ping the Whonix-Gateway. Will ''NOT'' work.

&lt;pre&gt;# You will not be able to ping the Whonix-Gateway,
# because ICMP is blocked by the firewall.
# If you want to test it, you have to adjust the firewall,
# or to deactivate the firewall while testing.
ping 192.168.0.10&lt;/pre&gt;

Power off Whonix-Gateway. Try to ping outside or to use the browser in Whonix-Workstation. Obviously, should NOT work.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

Power on Whonix-Gateway again. Visit https://check.torproject.org/ with Tor Browser. You should see a “Congratulations”.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

Use a Tor Browser to visit a .onion address (Try the [http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion torproject.org hidden service])

&lt;pre&gt;http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion&lt;/pre&gt;

Whonix {{Whonix6}} and above: Test Tor Button's New Identity Feature.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: Ping commands should NOT work for external addresses from your Whonix-Workstation, ICMP traffic&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol&lt;/ref&gt; is not proxied, and filtered by Whonix's Firewall ({{WhonixFirewall}}), because Tor does not support UDP.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Code2|dig google.com}} must only return a single IP, compare with the output on Whonix-Gateway or Host.

&lt;pre&gt;dig google.com&lt;/pre&gt;

Test gpg.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Example:
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89
&lt;/pre&gt;

Test wget uwt wrapper.

&lt;pre&gt;wget http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion&lt;/pre&gt;

Test wget through TransPort.

&lt;pre&gt;/usr/bin/wget http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion&lt;/pre&gt;

Setup a hidden service on Whonix-Gateway and test if it works. You can access your own test hidden service using Tor Browser.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

See if whonixcheck gets autostarted.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

Test XChat, connect to a an SSL protected IRC server.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

test XChat, connect to a hidden IRC server.

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

Whonix {{Whonix6}} and above:

Install lighttpd.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install lighttpd&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart lighttpd.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service lighttpd restart&lt;/pre&gt;

Try to download the local index.html.

&lt;pre&gt;wget.real 127.0.0.1&lt;/pre&gt;

Check.

&lt;pre&gt;cat index.html&lt;/pre&gt;

Let's check if git is working. A good testing target would be a hidden git server. Therefore, check if [http://wzrtr6gpencksu3d.onion Gittor] is online by visiting its list of [http://wzrtr6gpencksu3d.onion/gitlab/public public Gittor repositories]. Test it.

&lt;pre&gt;git clone http://wzrtr6gpencksu3d.onion/gitlab/w00t/pgp-auth.git&lt;/pre&gt;

Check if regular git servers are reachable as well.

&lt;pre&gt;git clone https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Default Browser ===
==== Quick Launcher ====
Check if the Tor Browser quick launcher (fav icon) next to the start menu button is visible and startable.

==== Text Links ====
1. Open Konsole.

2. Run the following command.

&lt;pre&gt;
echo http://127.0.0.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

3. Right click on the echoed {{Code2|http://127.0.0.1}} and choose open link.

4. Check if it opens asks for confirmation to open that file in Tor Browser. Check if nothing happens, when pressing {{Code2|No}} (which should be the default!) and check if it opens a new Tor Browser window when pressing {{Code2|Yes}}.

==== File Links ====
1. Create a file {{Code2|~/test.html}} with the following content.

&lt;pre&gt;
test
&lt;/pre&gt;

2. Open Dolphin (default file manager) and double click on that file.

3. Check if it opens asks for confirmation to open that file in Tor Browser.

==== Terminal ====
1. Open Konsole.

2. Run the following command.

&lt;pre&gt;
x-www-browser http://127.0.0.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

3. Check if it opens asks for confirmation to open that file in Tor Browser.

4. Check the same for.

&lt;pre&gt;
gnome-www-browser http://127.0.0.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

5. Check the same for.

&lt;pre&gt;
xdg-open http://127.0.0.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Applications ===

* [[Metadata]]
* [[Mixmaster]]
* [[Tor Browser]]
* [[Manually_Updating_Tor_Browser]]: Check if Tor Browser Bundle 3.0 runs in Whonix out of the box (without using the {{Code|torbrowser}} script).

}}
= Summary =
This is a proposal to defend a '''permanent takedown threat'''. A mechanism to securely download project metadata, which includes censor resistance, defeating rollback and infinite freeze attacks.

Both, &lt;code&gt;TUF (The Update Framework)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.updateframework.com/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf&lt;/ref&gt; and pdt, do not require software to be running on a server and can be run on any (free) web space.

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;&lt;s&gt;In comparison to &lt;code&gt;TUF (The Update Framework)&lt;/code&gt;, it does not require software to be running on a server and can be run on any (free) web space.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;-- This was a [https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/issues/78 misconception].&lt;/font&gt;

= Definitions =

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;Definition by adrelanos:&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Project metadata'''. Is defined as version information, news, update information, project homepage and so on.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;Definition by adrelanos:&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Permanent takedown threat.''' An attacker takes down a mirror by taking over the domain or by taking down the server using DoS&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack&lt;/ref&gt; attack, cracking down the server with malware or by pressuring humans (the server administrator).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;Quote: &lt;code&gt;TUF: Attacks and Weaknesses&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=tufaaw&gt;https://www.updateframework.com/projects/project/wiki/Docs/Security http://www.webcitation.org/6F7Io2ncN&lt;/ref&gt;:&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Rollback attacks.''' An attacker presents a software update system with older files than those the client has already seen, causing the client to use files older than those the client knows about.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;Quote: &lt;code&gt;TUF: Attacks and Weaknesses&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=tufaaw /&gt;:&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Indefinite freeze attacks.''' An attacker continues to present a software update system with the same files the client has already seen. The result is that the client does not know that new files are available.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

= Motivation =

What happens if an adversary ever manages to ban project websites such as Tails or Whonix? Boum.org domain and server seizure, Whonix kicked from sf.net.

The project admins will lose the ability to inform their users about critical security updates and communications break down. Users will no longer be able to visit the original homepage, which could even get replaced with a malicious version.

It would take some time to reorganize hosting, move to censor resistant hosting and to inform the existing user base.

= Discussion =

Using a single server, i.e. single domain/server for project metadata is recommended against, as it introduces a single point of failure. When the server goes offline, project metadata can no longer be distributed. The server could also serve either due to a bug or by malicious indent a gpg signed, but outdated project metadata.

To prevent disclosing which software is fetching project metadata, the request must go through Tor. Identity correlation through circuit sharing must be circumvented by using a separate circuit for project metadata fetches.

GPG signing of project metadata is a must, since it's independent from SSL certificate authorities.

The public key of the signer must be included into the software project at build time. Distributed trust could be implemented by using X signing keys and defining, that project metadata has to be signed by at least Y of X signers to be accepted as valid.

To my knowledge, there isn't any distributed censor resistant data storage available over Tor. Freenet is a distributed censor resistant data storage, which can unfortunately not be accessed over Tor. &lt;ref&gt;Freenet could be accessed over Tor, by tunneling UDP over Tor using a VPN. This is too unsuitable for most users to be considered as a workaround. Most VPNs cost money, VPN over Tor is a hack alone and there are not as many VPN nodes as Tor exits, are there?&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise Freenet could be well suited for this purpose.

= Implementation =

There are web services run by different organizations, which allow (free) web hosting, which can be used for project metadata. Examples are github pages, sourceforge file release system and a free onion hosting services. &lt;ref&gt;Such as [http://torhostg5s7pa2sn.onion/ torhost].&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is an example, how a project metadata file could look like.

&lt;pre&gt;
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

projectversion: 0.4.5

metadataversion: 536
validuntil: 1369159330

homepage: http://whonix.sourceforge.net/

news: No important News.

mirror 1: http://whonix.sourceforge.net/whonix_news.asc
mirror 2: http://su6ephfi7dtxnbtb.onion/whonix_news.asc
mirror 3: https://adrelanos.pages.github.com/whonix_news.asc

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

xxxSIGNATURExxx
-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
&lt;/pre&gt;

Such a project metadata file is supposed to be initially copied into the project's binary distribution at build time. The purpose is to initially equip the metadata fetcher with a list of mirrors.

From all available mirrors, the metadata fetcher uses all &lt;ref&gt;Or if load balancing is required, using multiple and random mirrors.&lt;/ref&gt; mirrors at each run time to download the current project metadata. If metadata mirrors are modified or expanded, the updated file will possibly be stored persistently and overrule the metadata file which was included at build time.

The ''projectversion'' variable contains the version of the project and can be anything. The ''homepage'' variable contains the latest homepage of the project. It can be useful to inform users about the new homepage in case the old one has been taken down. The ''news'' variable contains a plain text string. Most of the times it shouldn't contain anything and should only be used to inform users about urgent things, such as when a takedown attack is in place.

The ''metadataversion'' variable is a consecutive number, i.e. after 536 follow 537. Each update of the metadata file increases that number. The client may not accept lower metadata version numbers, than the client already knows about. This should defeat rollback attacks.

Defeating indefinite freeze attacks is technically a bit more difficult. Each metadata fetch against a different mirror has to go through its own Tor circuit. Going through its own Tor circuit, most times a different Tor exit will be used (and connections to hidden services are stream isolated so or so). This will result in using different ISP's to connect to the metadata mirror and as long as not all Tor exit relays or all Tor exit relays's ISPs or all metadata mirrors are compromised, no indefinite freeze attack can be successfully mounted. When fetching from hidden services, there are no ISP's involved, who could tamper with the metadata.

The ''validuntil'' variable represents how long the file is valid, until the mirror is considered outdated. The number represents the time in unixtime&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time&lt;/ref&gt;. If a mirror is considered outdated, a new mirror will be tried.

Distributed trust for the signers has not yet been considered. The signers gpg key is fully trusted. To implement this, one could look into the TUF project, since the TUF project already contains code to define a threshold of signers.

Specifically for Whonix, [[whonixcheck]] and the [[Dev/News|Whonix News Format]] could be extended.

|description=i2p over Tor. Tunnelling the i2p Anonymizing Network over the Tor Anonymizing Network. Connection Schema: Tor -&gt; i2p -&gt; Destination.
}}

= i2p anonymizing network =

== Introduction ==

TODO: write introduction into i2p.

You can either use inproxies inside Whonix-Workstation to browse eepsites or install i2p inside Whonix-Workstation.

The inproxy method is more suited for a causal use of i2p, where you just want to anonymously view an eepsite and don't care about eavesdroppers as long you are anonymous.

Instaling i2p inside Whonix-Workstation is safer, all i2p traffic gets tunneled through Tor, fully featured but a tiny bit more difficult than installing i2p the ordinary way, i.e. using i2p in the clear, not over Tor.

* [https://www.i2p2.de/debian.html Debian I2P Packages]

== Inproxies inside Whonix-Workstation ==

There are several i2p inproxies, those are similar to tor2web&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/tor2web&lt;/ref&gt;. Simply use [[Tor Browser]], which comes with Whonix by default.

Note that you will loose the end-to-end encryption to the eepsites, which i2p would provide, if you would install it directly inside Whonix-Workstation, or if you would use it the ordinary way. Depending on if the inproxy uses http (unencrypted), http'''s''' (or is reachable through a hidden service), also [[Warning#Tor_exit_nodes_can_eavesdrop_on_communications|Exit Nodes Eavesdropping]] applies. In any case, the i2p inproxy admin can see, all your traffic into the i2p network and there is no way to prevent that.

List of i2p inproxies:

* &lt;s&gt;awxcnx i2p eepsite inproxy&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;[https://www.awxcnx.de/tor-i2p-proxy2-en.htm clearnet SSL version]&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;[http://a5ec6f6zcxtudtch.onion/tor-i2p-proxy2-en.htm Tor hidden service version]&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;[http://awxcnx.i2p/tor-i2p-proxy2-en.htm I2P eepsite version]&lt;/s&gt;
* &lt;s&gt;awxcnx i2p IRC inproxy (See [[Chat]] for general chat safety advice.)&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;[https://www.awxcnx.de/i2p-irc-en.htm clearnet SSL version]&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;[http://a5ec6f6zcxtudtch.onion/i2p-irc-en.htm Tor hidden service version]&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;[http://awxcnx.i2p/i2p-irc-en.htm I2P eepsite version]&lt;/s&gt;
* &lt;s&gt;[http://6dyi4t72u7y6g763.onion/ 6dyi4t72u7y6g763.onion]&lt;/s&gt;
* &lt;s&gt;or simply add '.to' after '.i2p'. For example, instant of ''http://forum.i2p'' you can use ''http://forum.i2p.to''.&lt;/s&gt;

== Installing i2p inside Whonix-Workstation (i2p over Tor) ==
'''Update''': &lt;br /&gt;
Accessing i2p's webinterface on 127.0.0.1 using Tor Browser is no longer possible due to a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10419 change] in Tor Browser by The Tor Project. You could set to transparent torification, but then you would be vulnerable fingerprinting issues. See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10419 ticket] for more.

It is possible to run i2p inside the Whonix-Workstation. Advantages:

* Anonymity is provided by Tor.
* [http://127.0.0.1:7657/confignet i2p router console] works normal inside Tor Browser. No need to install a graphical user interface on the Whonix-Gateway.
* Eepsites (.i2p) can be reached directly from Tor Browser.
* i2p's end-to-end encryption will be used like usual.

Disadvantages:

* Adds load to Tor.
* Adds load to i2p.
* It's slower than i2p directly on Whonix-Gateway or the ordinary usage.
* No contribution (leaching) to the i2p network. &lt;ref&gt;Sounds worse than it is. Only very little people are expected to use i2p over Tor. i2p offers those options itself. It's not like a leeching mod.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommended settings:

* Tor Browser
** Use a [[Advanced_Security_Guide#More_than_one_Tor_Browser_in_Whonix|second instance of the Tor Browser]], [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots|multiple VM Snapshots]] or [[multiple Whonix-Workstations]].
** Add &lt;u&gt;http&lt;/u&gt; proxy IP: 127.0.0.1 port: 4444 in Tor Browser's Tor Button settings.
* [http://127.0.0.1:7657/confignet i2p Network Settings]
** IP configuration: hidden mode (do not publish IP) &lt;ref&gt;There is no need to publish the exit relay's IP address. It wouldn't work. Tor does not support incoming connections (server ports) unless hidden services are used. i2p very unlikely to support Tor hidden services, since they have their own network design.&lt;/ref&gt;
** UDP-Port: completely disable &lt;ref&gt;UDP is unsupported by Tor.&lt;/ref&gt;
** TCP: disable inbound (Firewalled) &lt;ref&gt;Only outgoing TCP supported by Tor.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;If you know to use a hidden service, please add this information.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;Incoming connections are not possible, because [[Install_Software#Whonix-Workstation_is_firewalled|Whonix-Workstation is firewalled]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://127.0.0.1:7657/configtunnels i2p Tunnels Settings]
** length (all tunnels): inbound and outbound: 0 &lt;ref&gt;It's faster and less connection interrupts. Anonymity is already provided by Tor. No need to leech from Tor/i2p.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://127.0.0.1:7657/configadvanced I2P Advanced Configuration]
** Add: &lt;pre&gt;time.sntpServerList=localhost&lt;/pre&gt;
** Click &quot;Safe Changes&quot;.

'''Clock skew issues'''

In Whonix Workstation 7 and I2P-0.9.11 it was possible to fix clock skews (I2P notices those at startup and complains about it) by switching '''sdwdate''' off: 

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service sdwdate stop
sudo chmod -x /etc/init.d/sdwdate
&lt;/pre&gt;

In Whonix Workstation 8 and I2P-0.9.11 this doesn't work - I2P complains about clock skews even after disabling both '''sdwdate''' and '''bootclockrandomization'''.

It is still possible to fix the clock manually. For example, if I2P reports a clock skew of 60 seconds at startup, use this command to change system time:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo date -s now-60sec
&lt;/pre&gt;

then restart I2P.

However, time sync management in Whonix is a complex issue, so before changing the default way of time management in Whonix, make sure to read [[Dev/TimeSync]] and understand the implications.

== Installing i2p on Whonix-Gateway (i2pBOX) ==

Was just a development idea with some progress. Moved to [[Dev/Inspiration]].

|description=Whonix Project Very Long Term Vision
}}

= Whonix² =

That's just a code name for a '''BOX''' setup &quot;2.0&quot; that may eventually offer strong guarantees of security and anonymity.

It should address all the current single points of failure:

'''CPU:''' Even in a microkernel + IOMMU system the CPU (and to some extend the GPU, this ) needs to be trusted blindly. The system needs to consists of multiple (diverse) CPUs. Whonix with Physical Isolation already does that. This is just an reminder that software based isolation (through next gen sandboxing and microkernel design) will never be able to replace hardware isolation.

'''Software/Compiler''' Even if the TCB is small and verifiable to some extent there is an inherently unsolvable problem: Compilers (&quot;trusting trust&quot;). The only option to improve this I see is to rely on a diverse &quot;polyculture&quot; of software stacks and infrastructure instead of our current Windows and gcc monocultures. (I suppose most .mil and all research microkernels are written on monolithic untrusted &quot;legacy&quot; systems). Alternatives do exist (most likely built with gcc...) but probably not mature enough, though I hear OpenBSD kernel can be built with pcc. clang/LLVM is probably the best bet. This also extends to the build system, workstations and gateways should be built on their respective target platforms, not a single build system.

'''Software updates:''' Currently, one single bad update from Debian and it's game over. Software updates are always a root &quot;backdoor&quot;, they grant unknown people full remote access to all your systems. This needs to be changed. If the TCB is small and well tested there won't be many security updates and they will be simple, small patches. Deterministic binary builds could make that userfriendly. At least we should not rely on a single organization to provide security updates for all systems in Whonix (this includes having the same upstream for complicated software, i.e. the Linux kernel...).

'''Tor:''' Currently, one serious Tor vulnerability and it's game over. Even with true end-to-end communications, if Tor (or its TCB) is subverted an adversary can find out who is talking and to whom one is talking. Whonix should route all traffic over at least two strong anonymity networks (not just single hop proxy/VPN/SSH). Further, there should be the option to use a high latency network. This could be as simple as a single hidden service (which would have to be fully trusted to not collude with our &quot;global adversary&quot;. A real solution would of course have to be decentralized. The only options so far are remailers (Mixminion...) but those have few users (poor anonymity set) which is probably related to their outdated user interface and experience. However, even with a small number of users, if remailers are routed through Tor they are still more secure than Tor (in this context the resulting anonymity is cumulative).

'''&quot;Protocol leaks&quot;, Anonymity set reduction:''' The current platform of choice (for pretty much everything, including anonymous communication) is the web browser. Browser really suck when it comes to privacy, anonymity or security. Allowing scripting, storing IDs (cookies and more), constantly changing features (html5, webgl, websockets...), [http://rdist.root.org/2010/11/29/final-post-on-javascript-crypto/ lack] of strong crypto environment make the web browser one of the worst platforms imaginable for strong anonymity (or security). Why? Because we also lack a credible alternative. One such alternative could have been the now dead or in limbo [http://syndie.i2p2.de/ Syndie] (&quot;Syndie's design as an anonymity-sensitive client application carefully avoids the intricate data sensitivity problems that nearly every application not built with anonymity in mind does not.&quot;)

'''In summary:''' Whonix² needs to consist of at least two very diverse systems, different hardware manufacturers, different kernels, different companies/orgs providing support and offer at least two different anonymizing networks. Bonus points for utilizing diverse crypto systems and cascades. Neither system should &quot;know&quot; both who is communicating and with whom.

|description=Anonymous Voice over IP (VOIP). Encrypted anonymous phone calls using the Tor Anonymity Network.
}}

= Voice over IP =

== Introduction ==

The Voice over IP Introduction chapter and instructions about mumble voice chat are finished. Instructions for other Voip clients aren't finished yet, but this shouldn't stop you from using mumble or experimenting with other clients. Please test and leave feedback!

Anonymizing Voice over IP is very difficult, if possible at all. It's not so much about hiding the IP, which is easy with Whonix, it's about voice recognition and slow Tor network speed (latency). Pseudonymous use or hidden voice communication with known contacts is possible. It depends on your threat model.

For people behind Tor, who know each other, talking to each other, it is possible to hide the fact that they are talking with each other, from their ISP, government, exit relays, man-in-the-middle, etc. That wouldn't be anonymous, because they know each other.

You can't anonymously use your own voice and whistleblow over Voip, be a snitch or whatever. Voice gets recorded and voice recognition works well. When you are having a phone call later over a non anonymous connection (which almost everyone had at least once in its life, so everyone supplied a sample of their voice and name), they can correlate the two identities. You would have to use a voice scrambler and how good that works is a whole new field for research, which is outside the scope of Whonix.

You could type and let a artificial voice speak (like in anonymous videos), that could work. But is that the point? You better write a mail then.

It's also recommended against to voice chat with other anonymous people. (Like you can talk in a forum.) You don't know who you are talking to. That voice also could be correlated later, putting aside voice scrambler, or artificial voice, which wouldn't make sense.

If you are not calling from .onion to .onion (which delegates encryption to Tor), you should use a Voip client supporting encryption, such as ZRTP&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRTP&lt;/ref&gt;. You'll find recommendations later below in the clients section.

Other than the things said above, adrelanos doesn't expect any additional anonymity/security problems. It's less tested, so as for performance and voice quality, just try it and see yourself and please leave feedback.

Please don't expect phone calls over Tor can't to be as convenient as phone calls over ordinary networks. This is because traffic is routed through the Tor network

Push to talk will always work however, which is more like using walkie-talkie&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkie-talkie&lt;/ref&gt;,  push-to-talk&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-to-talk&lt;/ref&gt;.

Useful advice has been given by guardianproject.info. They recommend to use prowords&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_word&lt;/ref&gt;. Acknowledge the end of transmission (your speech, your sentence, what you just said) with the word &quot;Roger&quot;. Once your calling partner hears &quot;Roger&quot;, it knows, it's safe to answer and also terminate the answer with &quot;Roger&quot; or &quot;Out&quot; when leaving the conversation.

== Voip Server ==

You most likely still require a Voip server. If no one of your group is interested in configuring a hidden Voip server, you could use a free one. I could imagine, that even latency is a bit better.

If the Voip ID gets anonymously registered, i.e. if no personal data is required for signing up, everyone only and always connects over Tor, never connected or will ever connect without Tor, and all calls are encrypted and you won't talk to strangers, I don't see what even a malicious server could do. &lt;ref&gt;Apart from trying to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security) exploit] random Tor users.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voip Clients ==

=== Recommendations ===

==== Jitsi ====

Jacob Appelbaum (Tor researcher) recommends&lt;ref&gt;https://jitsi.org/Main/News&lt;/ref&gt; Jitsi&lt;ref&gt;https://jitsi.org/&lt;/ref&gt;. It supports OTR encryption and ZRTP. Unfortunately it is not yet&lt;ref&gt;http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=jitsi&lt;/ref&gt; in Debian Stable or Testing. But it will be in a few days in Debian testing. Beginning with next Whonix version (6 and above) you can most likely easily install it using {{Code|sudo apt-get install jitsi}}. In meanwhile you would have to download and install it manually following the instructions on Jitsi homepage for Debian.

Jitsi supports push to talk.

'''TODO''': write a guide on how to connect to a free public server, having a secure ZRTP encrypted conversation with someone using the same client.

==== sflphone ====

Nathan Freitas (Tor Orbot developer) likes&lt;ref&gt;https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-February/027204.html&lt;/ref&gt; sflphone&lt;ref&gt;http://sflphone.org/&lt;/ref&gt;. Can be installed from Debian package sources.

It does not support OTR. You would have to keep that in mind and use another way to exchange encrypted text. This isn't a reason, not to use it, if you are aware of that.

'''TODO''': research, does sflphone support push to talk?

'''TODO''': write a guide how to connect to a free public server, having a secure ZRTP encrypted conversation with someone using the same client.

==== mumble ====

===== Introduction =====

mumble&lt;ref&gt;http://mumble.sourceforge.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

* Looks a bit like Team Speak without its disadvantages.
* It's Open Source.
* And supports client to server encryption.&lt;ref&gt;http://mumble.sourceforge.net/FAQ/English#Is_Mumble_encrypted.3F&lt;/ref&gt;
* Supports push to talk.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mumble.com/support/mumble-server-push-to-talk.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* You can (and must) force TCP mode&lt;ref&gt;http://en.kioskea.net/faq/26187-mumble-force-tcp-mode&lt;/ref&gt;, because the Tor network does not support UDP yet.
* One has to act as server.
* Everyone else can act as client.
* If the server admin runs the server on its local machine and also wants to connect to the server, the admin should connect locally to the server, i.e. to 127.0.0.1 and not the hidden service domain to have faster connection.
* For group chats you have to consider, that there is no end-to-end encryption and once the server acts malicious, all conversions are unsafe. However, if two people use mumble just to talk to each other this doesn't matter and you could safely do that with mumble.
* When one of the two communication partners hosts a mumble server as Tor hidden service and the other one connects over Tor, encryption is already provided by Tor. There are different ways to achieve security. In this case, setting a server password (explained below), should be sufficient. &lt;font size=-3&gt;Mumble's own encryption isn't required. Alternatively, feel free to learn about mumble certificates for defense in depth, channel passwords instead of server password and so on.&lt;/font&gt;

===== Mumble Server Instructions =====

If you want to read and introduction about hidden services and to learn about about hidden service security, see [[Hidden Services]].

On Whonix-Gateway.

Open your {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc&lt;/pre&gt;

Add.

HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/mumble_service/

If you also want to run a hidden web server on the same .onion domain, optionally add. (Nice for testing, see [[Hidden Services]], you can comment it out later.)

&lt;pre&gt;HiddenServicePort 80 192.168.0.11:80&lt;/pre&gt;

Also add.

&lt;pre&gt;HiddenServicePort 64738 192.168.0.11:64738&lt;/pre&gt;

Reload Tor.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service tor reload&lt;/pre&gt;

Reminder: To get your hidden service url.

&lt;pre&gt;## must be root: sudo su
nano /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname&lt;/pre&gt;

Reminder: Backup your hidden service key, in case you want to be able to restore it, on another machine, on a newer Whonix-Gateway, after hdd failure, etc.

&lt;pre&gt;## must be root: sudo su
/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/private_key&lt;/pre&gt;

On Whonix-Workstation.

Update package lists.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/pre&gt;

To host a mumble server, install. (Currently a bit more difficult, see [[Special:AWCforum/st/id232/#post_1098|forum]].)

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install mumble-server&lt;/pre&gt;

Configure the server.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo dpkg-reconfigure mumble-server&lt;/pre&gt;

The following questions...

* Autostart, better yes. Otherwise you would have to &quot;sudo service mumble-server start&quot;, which didn't work for me.
* Higher priority? Yes.
* Password: choose a secure password.

There is also an upstream [http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Running_Murmur Murmur], i.e. mumble server guide. The upstream guide does not consider hidden services, that's the part already described here. For any other questions regarding the server setup, you can also refer to the upstream documentation.

Set a server password. Open ''/etc/mumble-server.ini''.

&lt;pre&gt;kdesudo kwrite /etc/mumble-server.ini&lt;/pre&gt;

Search for &quot;''serverpassword=''&quot; and file in.

&lt;pre&gt;serverpassword=use_a_long_and_secure_server_password&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart mumble-server.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service mumble-server restart&lt;/pre&gt;

===== Mumble Client =====

====== Installation ======

Update package lists.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/pre&gt;

Install mumble.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install mumble&lt;/pre&gt;

====== Start ======

Start mumble.

&lt;pre&gt;Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; Internet -&gt; Voice Chat.&lt;/pre&gt;


====== Configure ======

Configure mumble to your linking.

Enable Force TCP mode.

&lt;pre&gt;Go to Configure -&gt; Check &quot;Advanced&quot; -&gt; Network -&gt; Check &quot;Force TCP mode&quot; -&gt; Ok&lt;/pre&gt;

====== Add Server ======

Add a new server:

&lt;pre&gt;
Server -&gt; Connect -&gt; Add new -&gt;

    Label   : anything, can be same as .onion domain name
    Address : your .onion domain name or,
              if the mumble server is running in your own
              Whonix-Workstation choose
              127.0.0.1
    Port    : 64738
    Username: anything
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can now connect to the server.

===== Technical Comments =====

&lt;ref&gt;Mumble (and mumble-server)'s connections go through Tor's TransPort. This shouldn't matter, because (connections to and ) hidden services (itself) are stream isolated so or so, see [[Stream Isolation]] for more information on TransPort, SocksPort, Stream Isolation and so on.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== List ====

There is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_VoIP_software Comparison of VoIP software] in wikipedia. The client should be Open Source and if you are not calling from .onion to .onion (and let Tor handle encryption) it should also support voice encryption such as ZRTP.

==== Development Ideas ====

[[OnionCat]] could be useful if tunneling UDP and/or ICMP tunneling over Tor should be required. It should be avoided if possible, because it add complexity to the setup and introduces more latency because connection always goes from hidden service to hidden service.

=== Warnings ===

==== TOR Fone ====

The developer of TOR Fone recommends against&lt;ref&gt;https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-February/027215.html&lt;/ref&gt; using TOR Fone. Quote: &quot;''I did not think this project as a finished product for practical use.''&quot; The project got overall a pretty bad review in the mailing list thread.

==== Skype ====

'''Does this mean that, for example, is my IP and location safe when using Skype?'''

Yes, IP and location is safe. Skype has been tested in Whonix, it &quot;works&quot; quite well, still recommended against. Some further comments you should be aware of:

Those are not Whonix or Tor issues, those are Skype issues. Consider Skype usage [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous rather than anonymous]]. Skype is closed source and given Skype's history (reading BIOS etc. just research) it's very much likely that they link all your account names inside Whonix-Workstation to the same pseudonym.

Also obviously, if you log into an account, which you have ever used without Tor, consider the account non-anonymous. You really should assume, that they have logs and link your Tor and non-Tor use together.

Security doesn't depend on your local security and key management, but on a third party, the Skype authority. Consider the Skype encryption broken by the Skype authority.

Another obvious thing, if you chat with people, who have not created their account over Tor and who have not always connected over Tor, it's also not so hard to guess who you are. Remember, you are not in control of Skype's encryption keys and Skype is not Open Source, thus do not rely on Skype's encryption.

Voice recognition software also got very sophisticated. Since you should be unsure if the Skype encryption is broken or not, voice recognition software could be used to find out who you are.

Also read [[DoNot#Do_not_mix_Modes_of_Anonymity.21|Do not mix Modes of Anonymity!]]

In conclusion Skype usage does not leak IP/location, but is discouraged anyway, unless you want to use it for circumvention only, without wanting to be anonymous or pseudonymous.

What's the point in using Skype if you and all your chat partners are also willing to create and use their accounts only over Tor? You are advised to use Skype alternatives.

|description=Development Notes about existing and new Virtualizers supported by Whonix... VirtualBox, Qemu, KVM, VMware etc...
}}
{{forkme}}
= Introduction =
''Whonix Example Implementation'' is based on VirtualBox. There was a development discussion about switching to a more secure Virtualization Platform and help is required.

In an ideal world, ''Whonix Example Implementation'' would support all Virtualization Platforms. Theoretically it could be done using [http://libvirt.org/ libvirt]. Practically libvirt is out of question. [https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html libvirt-users Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?] Libvirt does not (yet) abstract some commands Whonix depends on.

= Other Virtualization Platforms =
== Introduction ==
In theory, Whonix could run inside any virtualizer, because its build scripts are very modular and extensible. In reality, Whonix has no man power to test other virtualizers than VirtualBox. As soon as contributors join the project and maintain support for other virtualizers, support for them can most likely be easily added.

== Support Plan ==
Whonix would need a contributor to support the other virtualization platform.

Important:

* Someone who runs those [[Test]], [[LeakTests]] and tests from [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Someone who otherwise looks around if everything is sane.

Ideal:

* Someone who creates, signs, uploads .ova images for the other virtualization platform (such as VMware, KVM, etc.).

== Partially Finished Attempts ==
* [[VMware]] (proof of concept)
* [http://qubes-os.org/ Qubes OS] as host operating system would be most interesting. It just needs someone sufficiently motivated to do a little work to make it reality, see blog post [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/featureblog/2013/02/running-whonix-on-top-of-qubes-os-anyone-interested-unpacking-ova-images/ Running Whonix on top of Qubes OS, anyone interested?.].
* [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/c0090dde/ Qemu / Virt-Manager] successful report in the forums
* KVM
** [[Dev/KVM]] - Virt-Manager (Qemu) KVM successful report in the forums and development discussion.
** [[KVM]] partially finished instructions.

= VirtualBox =
== VirtualBox missing features ==
The following is non-ideal for [[Comparison_with_Others#Verifiable_Builds|verifiable builds]], because we have to convert to vdi first:

* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=58460 export VM using VDI instead of VMDK?]: seems not possible.
* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=58461 Mount VMDK on Debian testing/jessie?]: seems not possible.

The following is non-ideal, because we can not warn when host operating sytems are being used we don't think are the right tool for hosting Whonix VMs:

* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=58498 Can a guest find out its host operating system?]: seems not possible.

* Virtual Box uses VMDK version 3. This is non-ideal, because working with these images is difficult.
** Converting these images is difficult.
*** qemu-img version 1.6.1 ({{Code|qemu-img convert &quot;vmdk_file&quot; -O RAW &quot;vdi_file&quot;}}) fails with: {{Code2|qemu-img: 'image' uses a vmdk feature which is not supported by this qemu version: VMDK version 3}}, which is a [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1253465 known issue in qemu].
*** Therefore it is required to convert them with VBoxManage to .vdi first. ({{Code|VBoxManage clonehd --format VDI &quot;vmdk_file&quot; &quot;vdi_file&quot;}})
** Therefore the Free guestmount doesn't support mounting VMDK version 3 as well (because it internally uses qemu-img).
** It requires proprietary software to mount them, such as the proprietary nbdkit plugin [https://github.com/libguestfs/nbdkit/blob/master/plugins/vddk/README.VDDK vddk]. We're not aware of a Free Software alternative yet.

== VirtualBox no longer in Debian main ==
* http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=709899
* http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00057.html
* &quot;Virtualbox ships a BIOS that requires Watcom to compile from real sources,precompiled copy they ship as well is free but is not the preferred form for modification.&quot; http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00106.html
* https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12011
* https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029978.html

== Arguments for keeping VirtualBox Support ==
* KVM is not available to Windows users.
* Simplicity, as in: VirtualBox has a VM import GUI feature.
* Available to users not owning computer providing hardware virtualization. (KVM requires that. Qemu does not?)
* Due to Windows users and simplicity it leads to greater popularity, which in theory attracts more users, developers, auditors, founding, etc and is therefore good for the overall health of the project.
* Some Windows/VirtualBox users experimenting with their first Linux (Whonix) will one day become users who mainly use Linux as their host operating system.

== Why Use KVM Over VirtualBox? ==
See [[KVM#Why_Use_KVM_Over_VirtualBox.3F|Why Use KVM Over VirtualBox?]]

|description=Using Vidalia with Whonix
}}

= Introduction =

'''Not recommended.'''&lt;ref&gt;Why? See [[Tor_Controller#Vidalia_recommended_against|here]].&lt;/ref&gt; '''Advanced users only!''' '''Not tested since version 0.1.3!''' Better use Arm. See [[Tor Controller]].

You have two possibility to get Vidalia. 1. Vidalia on the Whonix-Gateway. 2. Vidalia on the Host and Each option has its pros and cons, we'll discuss here.

= 1. Vidalia on the Whonix-Gateway =
You need to boot into a graphical user environment, see also [[Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]]. Essentially, you need to assign at least 512 MB RAM to Whonix-Gateway, 768 MB RAM for better performance. The latter is the default setting.

Install Vidalia.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install vidalia
&lt;/pre&gt;

You'll be asked to add user {{Code2|clearnet}} and {{Code2|rawdog}} to the debian-tor group, don't do this, as it is unnecessary. To get out of the debconf dialog, just press Tab followed by Enter. Probably no harm done if you mess(ed) that up and added {{Code2|clearnet}} and/or {{Code2|rawdog}}.

You can then start Vidalia from the start menu or from Terminal (Konsole) starting {{Code|vidalia}}.

= 2. Vidalia on the Host =
'''Untested since Whonix 6 and above!'''

Ok, this is an ugly hack, but it works. Vidalia can be installed on the host, in this example on a Windows host but you can most likely do it also on a Linux host. We have to &quot;trick&quot; Vidalia because Vidalia insists on starting Tor itself, which is already running on Whonix-Gateay.

You will be able to stop Tor using Vidalia, but not be able to start it again. Restarting Tor has to be done manually in Whonix-Gateway (or by ssh). &quot;Start proxy application when Tor starts&quot; will probably work (untested) but it will start it on the host and not on the Whonix-Gateway. What also won't work are all settings which modify torrc, because our torrc will be just a dummy one and the real torrc is inside the Whonix-Gateway. All settings in the settings, network tab won't work. Neither the &quot;Sharing/Setup Relaying&quot; tab will work (there will be instructions how to do it manually in torrc for the Whonix-Gateway). Services tab will also not work, this is covered above under [[Hidden Services]]. The &quot;Start Tor&quot; button will actually not start Tor, but connect to the Control Port inside the Whonix-Gateway. &quot;View the network&quot;, &quot;Use a New Identity&quot; and &quot;Message Log&quot; should be functional.

(0) You need to ensure yourself, that port 9051 is firewalled on your host. It must not be accessible from the internet.

(1) Create a folder Vidalia somewhere you like it. Ensure that your current user account has the necessary rights read, create, modify.

(2) Grab some dummy exe, for example cmd.exe from C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe and copy it to your new Vidalia folder.

(3) Login as root sudo su. Go to your Whonix-Gateway and type in console.

&lt;pre&gt;
tor --hash-password password
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will result in something like

&lt;pre&gt;
16:E61CFDC2FF3FDCDE605D8EDC3631F268B554612B0721E99F95588282B5

## copy it into the clipboard.
&lt;/pre&gt;

(4) Open your {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
&lt;/pre&gt;

And add.

&lt;pre&gt;
ControlPort 9051
ControlListenAddress 10.0.2.15:9051
HashedControlPassword 16:E61CFDC2FF3FDCDE605D8EDC3631F268B554612B0721E99F95588282B5
&lt;/pre&gt;

(5) nano {{WhonixFirewall}} and look out for the following

&lt;pre&gt;
## Allow incoming SSH connections on the external interface
iptables -A INPUT -i $EXT_IF -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
&lt;/pre&gt;

and add additionally the following below

&lt;pre&gt;
## Allow incomming Tor ControlPort connections on the external interface
iptables -A INPUT -i $EXT_IF -p tcp --dport 9051 -j ACCEPT
&lt;/pre&gt;

(6) Then go to your host and create a file named control_auth_cookie inside your Vidalia folder. Insert the password only, this example we used &quot;password&quot;. Choose your secure password. control_auth_cookie has no file extension, be sure that Windows will normally show you file extensions (like .exe, .pdf...), otherwise you will be probably unable to create a file without extension.

(7) We need a start file, otherwise Vidalia will use the default documents and settings folder. Call it vidalia.bat and create it inside your Vidalia folder. The content of vidalia.bat must be

&lt;pre&gt;
start do_not_start.exe --datadir .\\
&lt;/pre&gt;

(8) And of course you will be needing the Vidalia binaries. Download the Tor Browser Bundle for your platform. Go to *\Tor Browser\App* and copy the following files into your Vidalia directory.

&lt;pre&gt;
libeay32.dll
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libgnurx-0.dll
mingwm10.dll
QtCore4.dll
QtGui4.dll
QtNetwork4.dll
QtXml4.dll
ssleay32.dll
vidalia.exe
&lt;/pre&gt;

tor.exe and tor-resolv.exe will not be needed (we have our own dummy tor.exe).

(9) Rename vidalia.exe to do_not_start.exe.

(10) Create a file called vidalia.conf inside your Vidalia directory. The content must be

&lt;pre&gt;
[Tor]
TorExecutable=.\\tor.exe
Torrc=.\\torrc
DataDirectory=.\\
UseRandomPassword=false
ControlPassword=password
Changed=true
ControlPort=9052
ControlAddr=127.0.0.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

(11) Create a file torrc inside your Vidalia directory, leave it empty, it's just another dummy file for Vidalia's fate.

(12) In the Whonix-Gateway VM network settings. Set up Port Forwarding: within the &quot;Adapter 1&quot; tab click &quot;Advanced&quot;, then Port Forwarding. Insert a new rule as follows: Name: Vidalia; Protocol: TCP; Host IP: 127.0.0.1; Host Port: 9052; Guest IP: leave blank; Guest Port: 9051

(13) That's it. From now you can vidalia.bat. For your convinience create a shortcut of vidalia.bat on your desktop.

Optional, for debugging if you have problems.

* We test if the IP/Port is reachable from the host. &lt;code&gt;telnet 192.168.0.10 9051&lt;/code&gt;, press enter should say &quot;514 Authentication required.&quot;

|description=Instructions for OpenPGP Verification of Whonix using Command Line
}}

You need to have GnuPG installed. GnuPG is the common OpenPGP implementation for Linux: it is installed by default under Debian, Ubuntu, Whonix and many other distributions.

First, download the [[Whonix Signing Key]].

Open a terminal and import Whonix signing key with the following commands:

&lt;pre&gt;
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the key]
cat patrick.asc | gpg --keyid-format long --import
&lt;/pre&gt;

The output should tell you that the key was imported:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg: key 2EEACCDA: public key &quot;Patrick Schleizer &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;&quot; imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''If you had already imported Whonix signing key in the past''', the output should tell you that the key was not changed:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg: key 2EEACCDA: &quot;Patrick Schleizer &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;&quot; not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''If you are shown the following message''' at the end of the output:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
&lt;/pre&gt;

Analyse the other messages as usual: this extra message doesn't relate to the Whonix signing key that you downloaded and usually means that you didn't create an OpenPGP key for yourself yet, which is of no importance to verify the virtual machine images.

Now, '''download the cryptographic signature''' corresponding to the virtual machine images you want to verify and save it in the same folder as the virtual machine images:

[[Download#Whonix_signature]]

Then, '''start the cryptographic verification''', it can take several minutes:

&lt;pre&gt;
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the .ova and the .asc]
gpg --keyid-format long --verify Whonix-Gateway-8.ova.asc Whonix-Gateway-8.ova
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''If the Virtual Machine image is correct''' the output will tell you that the signature is good:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg: Signature made Fri 21 Feb 2014 05:41:12 PM CET using RSA key ID 77BB3C48
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Patrick Schleizer &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;&quot; [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 916B 8D99 C38E AF5E 8ADC  7A2A 8D66 066A 2EEA CCDA
     Subkey fingerprint: 6E97 9B28 A6F3 7C43 BE30  AFA1 CB8D 50BB 77BB 3C48
&lt;/pre&gt;

This might be followed by a warning saying:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
&lt;/pre&gt;

This doesn't alter the validity of the signature according to the key you downloaded. This warning rather has to do with the trust that you put in Whonix signing key and the [[OpenPGP#The_OpenPGP_Web_of_Trust|web of trust]]. To remove this warning you would have to personally sign Whonix signing key with your own key.

'''If the Virtual Machine image is not correct''' the output will tell you that the signature is bad:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg: Signature made Sun Nov 25 21:48:54 2012 UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 77BB3C48
gpg: BAD signature from &quot;Patrick Schleizer &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Repeat these steps for Whonix-Workstation as well.'''

&lt;pre&gt;
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the .ova and the .asc]
gpg --keyid-format long --verify Whonix-Workstation-8.ova.asc Whonix-Workstation-8.ova
&lt;/pre&gt;

You need to have the ''kgpg'' package installed. If you're not sure or want to install it, under Debian, Ubuntu or Whonix you can issue the following commands:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install kgpg
&lt;/pre&gt;

First, download the [[Whonix Signing Key]].

Open {{Code|adrelanos.asc}} with kgpg.

You will get notified will the following message:

(E-mail was changed to adrelanos at riseup do net, but this doesn't change anything, since the key fingerprint remains the same.)

[[Image:kgpg_key_imported_new.png]]

Or if you previously already imported the key:

[[Image:kgpg_key_imported_unchanged.png]]

Now, '''download the cryptographic signature''' corresponding to the virtual machine image ({{Code2|.ova}}) you want to verify '''and store it in the same folder as the virtual machine image''':

[[Download#Whonix_signature|Download Whonix Signature]]

Start kgpg, go to kgpg -&gt; File -&gt; Open Editor -&gt; Signature -&gt; Verify Signature... -&gt; Choose the downloaded cryptographic signature ({{Code2|.asc}}).

It will '''take a while''' and there is '''no progress meter'''. Please wait a few moments.

'''If the virtual machine image is correct''' you will get a notification telling you that the signature is good:

(E-mail was changed to adrelanos at riseup do net, but this doesn't change anything, since the key fingerprint remains the same.)

[[Image:kgpg_verification_success.png]]

'''If the virtual machine image is not correct''' you will get a notification telling you that the signature is bad:

(E-mail was changed to adrelanos at riseup do net, but this doesn't change anything, since the key fingerprint remains the same.)

}}

GnuPG, a common free software implementation of OpenPGP has versions and graphical frontends for both Windows and Mac OS X. This also make it possible to check the cryptographic signature with those operating systems:

[http://www.gpg4win.org/ Gpg4win], for Windows.

[http://www.gpgtools.org/ GPGTools], for Mac OS X. [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029256.html Getting a GnuPG version for Windows in a secure way]

You will find on either of those websites detailed documentation on how to install and use them.

'''For Windows using Gpg4win'''

After installing Gpg4win, download the [[Whonix Signing Key]].

[http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_15.html Consult the Gpg4win documentation to import it]

Then, download the cryptographic signature corresponding to the virtual machine image you want to verify: &lt;br /&gt;
[[Download#Whonix_signature|Whonix Signature]]

[http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_24.html#id4 Consult the Gpg4win documentation to check the signature]

If you see &quot;{{Code2|Not enough information to check signature validity}}&quot; as shown below.

[[File:Kleopatra_not_enough_information_to_check_signature_validity.png|alt=&lt;translate&gt;Kleopatra Not enough information to check signature validity&lt;/translate&gt;|400px]]

This warning equals.

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
&lt;/pre&gt;

See [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command_line|TODO]] for explanation.

'''For Mac OS X using GPGTools'''

After installing GPGTools, you should be able to follow the instruction for [[Verify the virtual machine images using the command line|Linux with the command line]]. To open the command line, navigate to your Applications folder, open Utilities, and double click on Terminal.

= Fail Closed Mechanism =

This is not a Whonix specific problem. It is a general problem with VPNs. Most users are simply not aware of it. VPN's generally fail open. VPN servers and VPN software can occasionally break down without announcement. This means, if the VPN is unreachable, connections breaks down for whatever reasons and so on, in most cases, you can continue to connect to the internet without the VPN.

If you want to enforce, that the VPN gets always used, see: https://github.com/adrelanos/VPN-Firewall

* Someone who runs those [[Test]], [[LeakTests]] and tests from [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Someone who otherwise looks around if everything is sane.

Ideal:

* Someone who creates, signs, uploads .ova images for VMware.
&lt;/ref&gt;

= Supported VMware Products =

'''VMware Workstation''' was tested. It's currently in a ''it works'' state, but ''rarely tested''.

'''VMware Server''' or other products are ''untested'', but perhaps also in a ''it works'' state.

'''VMware Player''' &lt;s&gt;is unsupported, because I don't see an option for internal networking.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;s&gt;Perhaps [[OneVM]] could work with VMware, but that would require even more contributions.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/s&gt; UPDATE: An anonymous user reported in the old forum&lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/84452a10/?limit=25&amp;page=1#8f27&lt;/ref&gt; that VMware Player works as well. Untested by adrelanos. This [http://xmodulo.com/2013/02/how-to-create-multiple-networks-on-vmware-player.html guide] contains instructions how to set up the internal network.

= About VMware =

Maybe I am a spoilt by Free Software (see &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software&lt;/ref&gt; for definition). VMware is not very open, but in my opinion openness is important for security. I haven't found out how to submit a bug report. It looks like only buying customers may submit bug reports and there is only community support for products, which are free in price. There is also no list with open bugs. Without a list of known bugs, I am unable to determine if VMware is suitable for Whonix, i.e. does not compromise the user's anonymity. Since bug reports remained entirely unanswered,it's also demotivating to investigate, contribute and submit further report bugs.

= VMware upstream bug reports =

* [http://communities.vmware.com/thread/423920 VMware bug report: failed to import .ova image]
* [http://communities.vmware.com/thread/423924 VMware bug report: .ova image internal network becomes bridged network]
* [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/11160 VirtualBox bug report Ticket #11160: .ova image created with VirtualBox, failed to import in VMware]

= HowTo =

Do not forget to read the [[Documentation]].

You can either import the [[Download]] version of manually build from source. Import Whonix-Gateway.ova and Whonix-Workstation.ova. Due to a VMware upstream bug, you may have to press ''retry'' when importing the .ova images.

Due to a VMware upstream bug the network settings have to be adjusted.

* Whonix-Gateway set ''network adapter'' '''2''' to custom, ''/dev/vmnet8'' (or on Windows probably: ''vmnet9'').
* Whonix-Workstation set ''network adapter'' '''1''' to ''custom'', ''/dev/vmnet8'' (or on Windows probably: ''vmnet9'').

'''Note''', if ''vmnetX'', such as for example ''vmnet8'' is already used by the NAT adapter, do not re-use it for the custom adapter. In that case, use something else, such as ''vmnet9''.

(Windows 8 specific forum help thread: &lt;br /&gt;
[[Special:AWCforum/st/id110/No_Tor/Internet_connection_on_VM....html|No Tor/Internet connection with Windows 8 on VMware - Whonix Gateway]].)

(Black screen forum help thread: &lt;br /&gt;
[[Special:AWCforum/st/id268/Gateway_7_issue_on_Vmware_workst....html]])

= Harden VMware =

* Remove printer
* Disable 3D acceleration
* Remove CD/DVD drive
* Remove floppy drive
* Remove USB controller (at least disable automatically connect new devices)
* Remove sound card
* Do not install VMware Tools or open-vm-tools (comfort vs. security)

= Security =

* Connect the virtual network adapter to custom. This is important! No host-only, no NAT, no bridging! I used VMnet9 virtual network, as it wasn't used by anything else.

One might wish to access the Whonix-Workstation through SSH. Therefore he could add a second network adapter with [http://www.vmware.com/support/ws55/doc/ws_net_configurations_hostonly.html Host-Only Networking]. Beware

&lt;pre&gt;
If you install the proper routing or proxy software on your host computer, you can establish
a connection between the host virtual Ethernet adapter and a physical network adapter on the
host computer. This allows you, for example, to connect the virtual machine to a Token Ring
or other non-Ethernet network.

On a Windows 2000, Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 host computer, you can use host-only
networking in combination with the Internet connection sharing feature in Windows to allow a
virtual machine to use the host's dial-up networking adapter or other connection to the
Internet. See your Windows documentation for details on configuring Internet connection
sharing.
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Tunnel Proxy/SSH/VPN through Tor =

== Required Knowledge ==

=== Introduction ===

'''user -&gt; Tor -&gt; Proxy/SSH/VPN'''

Read first: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor Plus VPN or proxy] and [[Whonix:General_disclaimer#Whonix_VPN_disclaimer|Whonix VPN disclaimer]].

You can tunnel through Tor first and add an additional proxy, SSH or VPN hop at the very end of that chain as your &quot;exit relay&quot;. The services you connect to, will not know, that you are using Tor &lt;ref&gt;Unless it's a &quot;transparent proxy&quot; in sense of sending http forwarded for, covered in the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor Plus VPN or proxy] article.&lt;/ref&gt;. This can be useful to '''evade Tor bans''', for example, to visit websites or IRC networks who blacklisted Tor. Beware of the risks, this adds a &quot;permanent exit relay&quot;, read [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor Plus VPN or proxy].

To do that, go to your Whonix-Workstation and add the proxy, SSH or VPN normally, just like you would do, if you wouldn't use the Whonix-Gateway. Adding your proxy, SSH or VPN inside Whonix-Workstation will, thanks to Whonix-Gateway, result in them getting tunneled over Tor.

Protocol leaks&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO&lt;/ref&gt; still apply, though to a lesser extent. Leaks would ''only'' leak through Tor and you have best possible [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].

=== uwt and Tor Browser ===
There are two special cases in Whonix: (1) applications using uwt and (2) Tor Browser.

Applications using uwt are pre-configured to use Socks Proxy settings. &lt;ref&gt;...and not just TransPort, which is a security feature: [[Stream Isolation]].&lt;/ref&gt; You may have to disable the affected uwt wrapper, in case there is one, for the application you want to tunnel. See [[Stream Isolation]] to learn what uwt and uwt wrappers are. You could [[Stream_Isolation#Deactivate_uwt_Stream_Isolation_Wrapper|disable]] them.

If you want to do it with Tor Browser, read [[Tor_Browser#Change/Remove_Proxy_Settings|Change/Remove Proxy Settings]].

=== Malware ===

Also note that once Whonix-Workstation gets rooted by malware, the VPN/SSH/proxy can be easily circumvented by the attacker and you are left to the protections by Whonix and Tor.

=== Leaks ===

If setting up socksifier, proxy settings, transparent proxy with local redirection, SSH tunnel or a VPN in a leak free manner were easy, this means while ensuring nothing will bypass the VPN, SSH or proxy, there would have been no reason to develop Whonix in the first place.

The methods described on this page are all tested and should all more or less work. Should there be any misconfiguration or leak bug, you are left to the protections by Whonix and Tor. This means, the leak will still go through Whonix-Gateway and therefore forced through Tor. The methods on this page are not as safe as a Whonix-Gateway. There were development discussions and some progress&lt;ref&gt;see [[Dev/Inspiration]]&lt;/ref&gt;, about chaining multiple Gateways, VPNBOX, JonDoBOX, i2pBOX, FreenetBOX and ProxyBOX, but nothing was finished due to the lack of community interest, support and developers.

=== Web Browser ===

I don't know how anonymous it is to use (proxy/VPN/SSH -&gt;) Tor -&gt; Proxy/VPN/SSH -&gt; Tor Browser -&gt; website. How many people show up with a proxy, VPN or SSH IP using Tor Browser? This setup is so special that I believe only very few people are doing it. For this reason, I recommend against.

On the other hand, due to browser fingerprinting, I can't recommend using any browser other than Tor Browser either.

== Tunnel proxy through Tor ==

'''user -&gt; Tor -&gt; proxy'''

Note that the connection, between the Tor exit relay and the proxy, is in most cases, not encrypted.

=== Proxy Settings Method ===

After understanding the ''Required Knowledge'' chapter above, using proxy settings in Whonix there is no difference from using proxy settings in an ordinary why, other than that it's running inside Whonix-Workstation.

If proxy settings are honored by application or in worst case leak through Tor alone (thanks to Whonix), is another question and not in Whonix's power, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO TorifyHOWTO].

=== Proxyfier Method ===

==== General ====

After understanding the ''Required Knowledge'' chapter above, using a Proxyfier in Whonix there is no difference from using a Proxyfier in an ordinary way, other than that it's running inside Whonix-Workstation.

If the Proxifier is leak free or in worst case leaks through Tor alone (thanks to Whonix), is another question and not in Whonix's power, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO TorifyHOWTO].

==== uwt ====
===== Introduction =====
uwt uses torsocks. While the name implies it's Tor specific, it's not. You can point it to any socks proxy.

===== uwt - wget Example =====
&lt;pre&gt;
## For Tor stream isolation #1
uwt -t 5 -i 192.168.0.10 -p 9153 /usr/bin/wget.real -c https://check.torproject.org

## For Tor stream isolation #2
uwt -t 5 -i 192.168.0.10 -p 9154 /usr/bin/wget.real -c https://check.torproject.org

## For Tor stream isolation #3
## Requires deactivated wget uwt wrapper!
uwt -t 5 -i 192.168.0.10 -p 9155 /usr/bin/wget -c https://check.torproject.org

## Proxy #1
uwt -t 5 -i x.x.x.x -p xxxx /usr/bin/wget.real -c https://check.torproject.org

## Proxy #2
## Requires deactivated wget uwt wrapper!
uwt -t 5 -i x.x.x.x -p xxxx /usr/bin/wget -c https://check.torproject.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Using .real, i.e. /usr/bin/wget.real will circumvent the wget uwt wrapper.&lt;/ref&gt;

For testing, if you didn't disable the wget uwt wrapper, the following command will most likely get another IP, because still using Stream Isolation.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Using Tor's TransPort
## (/usr/bin/wget.real original non-uwt-wrapped version)
wget.real https://check.torproject.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you [[Stream_Isolation#Deactivate_uwt_Stream_Isolation_Wrapper|disabled]] wget's uwt wrapper, you could use.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Using Tor's TransPort
## Requires deactivated wget uwt wrapper!
wget https://check.torproject.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

===== uwt - Tor Browser Example =====
Do not forget to [[Tor_Browser#Change.2FRemove_Proxy_Settings|Remove Proxy Settings]] from Tor Browser.

Then try this command. (Untested! Please leave feedback if it worked for you!)

&lt;pre&gt;
uwt -t 5 -i 192.168.0.10 -p 9153 ~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile
&lt;/pre&gt;

See also the wget example above for more information and usage examples.

==== proxychains ====
===== Warnings =====

* We don't know how well proxychains works. For example &lt;code&gt;torsocks has a IPv6 leak bug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/torsocks#WorkaroundforIPv6leakbug&lt;/ref&gt;. We don't know if proxychains forces everything through the proxies. Whonix only ensures, should their be leaks, they go only through Tor.
* There are at least three different versions of proxychains. The old/original/unmaintained version on sourceforge.net and two forks on github. We don't know about that status of any of them and haven't heard of anyone looking if they do really work as expected. The two authors argue with each other and we weren't motivated to understand the conflict and to determine which version is better. However, any leaks not going through the proxy(chain) will go through Tor.

===== Instructions =====
====== General ======
Install proxychains.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install proxychains&lt;/pre&gt;

Note the uwt and Tor Browser notice in {{Code2|Required Knowledge}} above first. After you have done so it's quite simple.

Open proxychains configuration file.

&lt;pre&gt;kdesudo kwrite /etc/proxychains.conf&lt;/pre&gt;

Go to the bottom of the settings file. Comment out &quot;{{Code2|socks4 127.0.0.1 9050}}&quot; and add for example &quot;{{Code2|socks5 192.168.0.10 9152}}&quot; (for Tor stream isolation) or &quot;{{Code2|socks5 ip port}}&quot; with an IP and port of your choice to set the proxy settings.

&lt;pre&gt;
[ProxyList]
## add proxy here ...
## meanwhile
## defaults set to &quot;tor&quot;
#socks4 127.0.0.1 9050
socks5 192.168.0.10 9152
# socks5 x.x.x.x xxxx
&lt;/pre&gt;

Advanced. Recommendation: Why not use Tor stream isolation for the proxychains connection?

&lt;pre&gt;
[ProxyList]
## add proxy here ...
## meanwhile
## defaults set to &quot;tor&quot;
#socks4 127.0.0.1 9050
socks5 192.168.0.10 9152
socks5 x.x.x.x xxxx
&lt;/pre&gt;

Safe the configuration file. Test afterwards.

====== test uwt wrapped application ======
For example:

&lt;pre&gt;proxychains /usr/bin/wget.real https://check.torproject.org&lt;/pre&gt;

Will do.

For testing, if you didn't disable the wget uwt wrapper, the following command will most likely get another IP. (Stream Isolation)

&lt;pre&gt;
## Using Tor's TransPort
## (/usr/bin/wget.real original non-uwt-wrapped version)
wget.real https://check.torproject.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

====== Tor Browser ======
Do not forget to [[Tor_Browser#Change.2FRemove_Proxy_Settings|Remove Proxy Settings]] from Tor Browser.

Then try this command. (Untested! Please leave feedback if it worked for you!)

&lt;pre&gt;
proxychains ~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Transparent Proxying ===

==== Introduction ====

To make clear, what this is about. Whonix-Gateway is already serving as a Transparent Proxy &lt;ref&gt;anonymizing middlebox&lt;/ref&gt;, which means, that all applications not explicitly configured &lt;ref&gt;by uwt socksifier or proxy settings&lt;/ref&gt; to use a SocksPort, can connect through Tor without any settings. The Transparent Proxying chapter on the ''Tunnel Proxy/SSH/VPN through Tor'' page is about configuring Whonix-Workstation also to act as a Transparent Proxy &lt;ref&gt;local redirection&lt;/ref&gt;. Use case: a user wants to ensure all traffic goes through Tor (by using Whonix-Gateway) and want to additionally ensure, all traffic goes through a proxy choosen by the user behind Tor, i.e. user -&gt; Tor -&gt; proxy.

&lt;ref&gt;[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/OptionalConfigurations?version=129#TransparentProxying torproject.org wiki version 129] contains an old example using privoxy, JonDo and httpsdnsd. The new example uses redsocks and is simpler.&lt;/ref&gt;

You always have to keep in mind, which kind of data and which kind of proxy you are using. There are CGIproxies, http(s) proxies and socks4/4a/5 proxies.

In case you redirect the network layer directly with iptables, you need a TransPort. Unfortunately very few applications, do offer a TransPort. For example, Tor supports a TransPort. In most other cases, you need to translate the different kinds of data.

Due to the nature of Transparent Proxying, we need to redirect with iptables and end up with a &quot;Trans data stream&quot;. Because most proxies are either http or socks we need to translate this. Below we discuss a few tools which help here, not all are required, depending on what you want to do.

Required reading:

* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/proxy proxy]
* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor Plus VPN or proxy]

===== Tools =====

Tor is a socks proxy and also has a TransPort. Unfortunately, Tor can not be directly used as a http proxy. You must also keep in mind, that Tor does not support UDP, although it offers a DnsPort..

[http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks/ redsocks] can also accept &quot;Trans data streams&quot; and can forward them to http'''s''', socks4 and socks5 proxies. If you were to use a http proxy (no https, without connect-method, see proxy article), you could access only http sites, no https sites. Rather redsocks can convert UDP DNS queries to TCP DNS queries.

===== DNS resolution =====

The complication (and also advantage/feature) with transparent proxying is, that the internet application (browser, etc.) is not aware of the proxy. Therefore the internet application will attempt to do the DNS resolution itself using the system, not using the proxy. The DNS requests also must be considered. Since Tor does not support UDP, we have to transmit DNS queries via TCP.

It is impossible to resolve DNS directly on the proxy, when using the proxy as a transparent proxy, see [[Dev/Inspiration#Transparent_Proxying_Method|Transparent Proxying Method]] for explanation. You need an extra DNS server, which answers over TCP.

You have several options to resolve DNS.

Either leave the setup as it is, Tor's DnsPort and therefore the Tor exit relays will still do the DNS requests. (See DNS rule #1.) This is probably not what you want, since you wanted to cloak your identity with an additional proxy after Tor.

Alternatively you can use a public DNS resolver. The instructions for [[Secondary DNS Resolver#DNSCrypt by OpenDNS]] should work out of the box (tested). (See DNS rule #2.) 

All DNS resolvers &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_server_software&lt;/ref&gt; should work, as long TCP is supported and as long you are querying a TCP enabled DNS server. &lt;ref&gt;You can't simply add another public DNS resolver (i.e. OpenDNS or Google) to /etc/resolv.conf in Whonix-Workstation (i.e. Tor -&gt; public DNS resolver), it would have no effect, as explained under [[Install_Software#Whonix-Workstation_is_firewalled|Whonix-Workstation is firewalled]].&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;Also [[Secondary DNS Resolver#httpsdnsd by JonDos]] might work, but you'd need to make some changes (use httpsdnsd as a system wide, Whonix-Workstation wide, DNS resolver, not just for a specific user account).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;DNSCrypt and httpsdnsd add the advantage, that neither the proxy nor the Tor exit relay can sniff or manipulate your DNS requests, since they are encrypted and authenticated.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Or perhaps also [http://www.mulliner.org/collin/ttdnsd.php ttdnsd] with Google could work.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Read the [[Secondary DNS Resolver|DNS related warnings]].

==== HowTo ====

Everything on Whonix-Workstation.

Get a working proxy and test if it works reliable.

Install redsocks.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Untested, easier. Please try and leave feedback.
sudo apt-get install redsocks

## Or compile from git.
#git clone https://github.com/darkk/redsocks.git
## Build latest stable. 0.4 at time of writing. See
## https://github.com/darkk/redsocks/tags for
## most recent tag.
#git tag -v &lt;version&gt;
#compile...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Config redsocks. TODO: share config. Shouldn't be hard to do oneself. See [https://github.com/darkk/redsocks/blob/master/debian/redsocks.conf default config]. If you do, please share.

Add user redsocks.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo adduser redsocks&lt;/pre&gt;

Start redsocks.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo -u redsocks ./redsocks&lt;/pre&gt;

Create a fw.sh and use this firewall rules.

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash
## These iptables rules redirect the traffic for all users,
## including root, with the exception of the user redsocks,
## through the proxy.

## TODO: these iptables rules need review.

## Choose either DNS rule #1 or DNS rule #2.

## For debugging/testing use this command in console.
## tail -f /var/log/syslog

## Flush old rules.
iptables -F
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -X

## Allow unlimited traffic on the loopback interface.
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT --dst 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT

## Established incoming connections are accepted.
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

## Established outgoing connections are accepted.
iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

## DNS rule #1.
## Allow DNS directly through Whonix-Gateway.
#iptables -A OUTPUT --dst 192.168.0.10 -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

## DNS rule #2.
## For DNSCrypt set /etc/resolv.conf to
## nameserver 127.0.0.1
##
## sudo dnscrypt-proxy --tcp-only --user=user
##
## DNSCrypt listening on port 53
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT --dst 127.0.0.1 -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT --dst 127.0.0.1 -p tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

## redsocks must be allowed to establish direct connections.
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT -m owner --uid-owner redsocks
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT -m owner --uid-owner redsocks

## Redirect remaining traffic to redsocks.
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-port 12345

## TODO: UDP rule untested.
#iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp -j REDIRECT --to-port 10053

## Log blocked traffic for debugging.
iptables -A OUTPUT -j LOG --log-level 4 --log-prefix &quot;iptables: &quot;

## Reject all other traffic.
iptables -A OUTPUT -j REJECT
&lt;/pre&gt;

Make the firewall script executable.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo chmod +x fw.sh&lt;/pre&gt;

Apply the firewall rules.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ./fw.sh&lt;/pre&gt;

== Tunnel SSH through Tor ==

'''user -&gt; Tor -&gt; SSH'''

This chapter is not about connecting to a SSH server as a client (see Whonix in general and the Torify HOWTO). It is about adding an extra SSH tunnel after Tor.

Note that even though SSH supports socks5, SSH is still not able to forward UDP on its own. Have a look at the [http://zarb.org/~gc/html/udp-in-ssh-tunneling.html source] of that information. To summarize: to tunnel UDP over SSH client and shell admin need a special setup, which is for most shells, not going to happen.

A SSH tunnel will provide a local socks5 proxy. Create the SSH tunnel in the Whonix-Workstation. From there you'll end up with a local socks5 proxy. You can use this socks5 proxy following the proxy instructions above. Once the SSH tunnel is established, there are not many differences, besides the difference already clarified above about UDP and that the warning about missing encryption to the proxy does not apply to SSH tunnels, since SSH is encrypted. The SSH process needs to be allowed to access the internet directly, if you use transparent proxying, run the SSH process under an account, which is privileged to access the internet directly.

Another untested method may be [https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle sshuttle].

== Tunnel VPN through Tor ==

'''user -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN'''

=== Notes ===

==== UDP ====

Note that you have to choose TCP transport, because Tor does not support UDP.

==== Using TransPort instead of SocksPort is required for Tor -&gt; VPN ====
For applications configured to use SocksPort, instead of TransPort, which is the default setting for most Whonix default applications, such as [[Tor Browser]]...

SocksPort is configured for [[Stream Isolation]]. As [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor Plus VPN or proxy] explains, you have to keep in mind, a VPN behind Tor adds a permanent exit relay.

Rather, all applications, which are configured to use SocksPort, will not be tunneled through the VPN. They will be &quot;only&quot; tunneled through Tor. This is because, the VPN will not touch connections to {{Code2|192.168.0.10}}, which is the Whonix-Gateway. For example, if you wish to tunnel Tor Browser through Tor -&gt; VPN, you have to remove all proxy settings from Tor Browser, see [[Tor_Browser#Change.2FRemove_Proxy_Settings|Change/Remove Proxy Settings]]. Check.torproject.org will tell you then &quot;{{Code2|You are not using Tor.}}&quot; and you'll see your VPN's IP. In fact your VPN was tunneled through Tor first. (Because Whonix-Workstation can not make any non-Tor connections by design, everything is tunneled over Tor.) When you stop your VPN for test reasons ({{Code2|sudo /etc/init.d/openvpn stop}}), it will show &quot;{{Code2|You are using Tor.}}&quot; again.

==== Use a Fail Closed Mechanism ====

This is not a Whonix specific problem. It is a general problem with VPNs. Most users are simply not aware of it. VPN's generally fail open. VPN servers and VPN software can occasionally break down without announcement. This means, if the VPN is unreachable, connections breaks down for whatever reasons and so on, in most cases, you can continue to connect to the internet without the VPN.

Whonix-Workstation will seamlessly continue to make &quot;direct&quot; connections through Tor once the VPN breaks down. If you are using the VPN only to connect to websites which ban Tor, you may not care so much. On the other hand, if you believe a VPN improves your security, it would be rational to make sure, the VPN is always used instead only most of the time.

If you want to enforce, that the VPN gets always used, see [[VPN-Firewall]].

==== VPN and stream isolation ====

While you are using a VPN behind Tor, you probably also may not be able to make use of the stream isolation feature &lt;ref&gt;[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3455 Bug #3455: Tor Browser should set SOCKS username for a request based on referer]&lt;/ref&gt;, which is planned for Tor Browser. This is because Tor Browser would not talk to Tor directly anymore. Tor Browser would connect to the VPN instead.

==== Identity correlation ====

By design, a VPN routes all your applications (those without any proxy settings, as explained above) through the VPN. You may not want this, as explained above ([[Stream Isolation]]). To circumvent that, you should use this Whonix-Workstation only for the particular application you want to route through the VPN. You are advised to read [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].

=== How ===

Just use general instructions on doing so and of course do it inside Whonix-Workstation. Don't forget to read all the notes above. Since everything is routed through Tor, the VPN can be easily tunneled through Tor.

See also [[TestVPN|Free example VPNs working with Whonix for testing purposes]].

|description=Workaround for Tunnelling UDP over Tor. Connection Schema: user -&gt; Tor -&gt; destination
}}

= Introduction =

The Tor software does not support UDP itself yet&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7830&lt;/ref&gt;. Whonix provides a limited workaround for using UDP anyway, in the best possible secure manner.

= VPN method (WORKING) =
Read first: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor Plus VPN] and [[Whonix:General_disclaimer#Whonix_VPN_disclaimer|Whonix VPN disclaimer]].

This tutorial uses OpenVPN. &lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;Other VPN implementations, such as PPTP, might be useful as well, but we haven't researched that yet. Maybe there are other VPN implementations, which also support UDP, and which are free and allow UDP. We haven't researched that yet.&lt;/font&gt;

Before setting up the VPN, you should make yourself familiar with curl and rdate. The rdate command line switch -p results in just showing the date and time, without setting it. -u uses UDP instead of TCP (default).

Test if your Whonix setup is working in general.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Enforcing SSL.
curl.real --tlsv1 --proto =https https://check.torproject.org

## Alternatively, not enforcing SSL, because some VPN services seem to block SSL.
curl.real http://check.torproject.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which should show &quot;Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor.&quot;.

Install rdate for UDP and TCP testing.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rdate
&lt;/pre&gt;

Commands for TCP testing are.

&lt;pre&gt;
rdate -p time.u.washington.edu
rdate -p time.nist.gov
rdate -p ptbtime1.ptb.de
&lt;/pre&gt;

Commands for UDP testing are.

&lt;pre&gt;
rdate -u -p time.u.washington.edu
rdate -u -p time.nist.gov
rdate -u -p ptbtime1.ptb.de
&lt;/pre&gt;

Your tests should reveal, that without a VPN, you can run TCP over Tor, but not UDP.

Obviously a VPN provider is required. Instructions setting one up can be found on the [[TestVPN]] page, the riseup and the usaip example is known to work for this purpose.

Test rdate again, first in TCP mode, then in UDP mode. Both should work.

= OnionCat =

See [[OnionCat]].

= SSH method (NOT DOCUMENTED) =

In theory we can also use SSH servers to tunnel UDP over Tor. Unfortunately we can't provide instructions here. Free SSH services are rarely available, that makes developing such a solution impossible. The existing free SSH services are blocking certain ports, which does not make this easier as well. Even though SSH can provide a socks5 proxy, it is not capable of providing [http://zarb.org/~gc/html/udp-in-ssh-tunneling.html support for tunneling UDP itself]. Extra software installed on the client, and even worse on the server is required (needs root). Most admins will not do this. The link in the instructions are most likely only useful for you, if you have your own server. But even then, you are probably better off, using the VPN method.

|description=Making Whonix Faster. Tuning Whonix.
}}

= Tuning =

== Introduction ==

'''Everything absolutely optional. Mostly largely untested!'''

At the top of the ''Tuning chapter'' are the easier tuning steps. The farther you go down, the more skill will be required.

== Increase Virtual Machine RAM ==

If [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Less_important_identifiers|less important identifiers]] are not important to you, and this is most likely very unimportant, you could use VirtualBox settings and increase the RAM for your Virtual Machine(s). Whonix-Workstation will profit most, if you run into low RAM. Also Whonix-Gateway could profit if you are creating big numbers of circuits and keep Tor busy. You can check how much RAM is free using ''free -m'' in Terminal.

== More CPU cores ==

On systems with multi-core processors, if [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Less_important_identifiers|less important identifiers]] are not important to you, and this is most likely unimportant, you could increase the number of cores available to the Virtual Machine(s) in VirtualBox settings.

== Removing packages ==

For example you could experiment with uninstalling Nepomuk and virtuoso.

== Replacing Desktop Environment ==
You could even uninstall KDE and use your own desktop environment or only cli. See [[Other_Desktop_Environments|Other Desktop Environments]].

== Synthetic CPU ==

If [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Less_important_identifiers|less important identifiers]] are not important to you, you could try if deactivating the Synthetic CPU increases performance for you.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo -u $USERNAME VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot; --synthcpu off
sudo -u $USERNAME VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; --synthcpu off
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Nested paging and VPIDs ==

You could increase performance by using Nested paging and/or VPIDs. It is unknown, if that may decrease security or stability. See VirtualBox manual: [http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch10.html#nestedpaging Nested paging and VPIDs] for more information.

&lt;pre&gt;
vboxmanage modifyvm Whonix-Workstation --largepages on
vboxmanage modifyvm Whonix-Gateway --largepages on

vboxmanage modifyvm Whonix-Workstation --vtxvpid on
vboxmanage modifyvm Whonix-Gateway --vtxvpid on
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Guest Additions ==

Not recommended for security reasons, but would improve performance, see [[VirtualBox Guest Additions]].

== Hardware-accelerated graphics ==

Requires Guest Additions, therefore not recommended, see above. Can increase performance.

See VirtualBox manual: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-3d Hardware-accelerated graphics].

== Memory ballooning, Page Fusion, Memory overcommitment ==

Requires Guest Additions, therefore not recommended, see above. Can increase performance.

See VirtualBox manual: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp18673360 Memory overcommitment].

== 64 bit architecture ==

Several methods. The last method is probably the most useful one.

Maybe it would enhance security and/or performance by using an amd64 kernel. I don't know how much sense that makes when the rest of the system is still 32 bit.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install linux-image-amd64
&lt;/pre&gt;

You could try to [http://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO Debian Multiarch HOWTO].

Or better create amd64 [[BuildDocumentation|builds yourself from source]]. Just open the file ''int_whonix_image'' and look for ''--arch i386'' and replace ''i386'' with ''amd64''. I believe that is all you need to build amd64 builds, but it is untested.

== Optimized builds ==

Since the concept behind Whonix isn't tied to anything, you could create your own implementation. Perhaps using Gentoo with optimized build flags for your system. See [[Dev/Technical Introduction#Whonix Framework|Whonix Framework]], [[OneVM]] and [[Hardened Gentoo TG]].

== PCI passthrough ==

Might greatly improve graphics performance. Might have security implications.

Essentially this feature allows to directly use physical PCI devices on the host by the guest even if host doesn't have drivers for this particular device. See VirtualBox Manual: [http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#pcipassthrough PCI passthrough].

|description=Get Whonix's OpenPGP signing key. Verify Whonix Downloads and/or Source Code.
}}
= Introduction =

Since all Whonix releases are signed with the same key, you will not have to verify the key every time and the trust you might progressively build in it will be built once and for all. Still, you will have to verify the signatures of the images every time you download a new release.

This page is strongly related to the [[Trust]] page.

= Download the key =
1. Copy and paste Patrick Schleizer's (adrelanos') OpenPGP key. &lt;html&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;link-https&quot; href=&quot;/patrick.asc&quot;&gt;patrick.asc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/html&gt; (Right click &amp; Save)

2. Store it as patrick.asc.

3. Import the key:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --import patrick.asc
&lt;/pre&gt;

4. Verify the key using this fingerprint:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --fingerprint 916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA
&lt;/pre&gt;

Should show:

&lt;pre&gt;
pub   4096R/2EEACCDA 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
      Key fingerprint = 916B 8D99 C38E AF5E 8ADC  7A2A 8D66 066A 2EEA CCDA
uid                 [ unknown] Patrick Schleizer &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;
sub   4096R/0x3B1E6942CE998547 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
sub   4096R/0x10FDAC53119B3FD6 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
sub   4096R/0xCB8D50BB77BB3C48 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;s&gt;5. For better security, read below.&lt;/s&gt;

= Trusting the Key =
== Download the key from multiple sources ==
Was a flawed concept. [[Deprecated#Download_the_key_from_multiple_sources|Deprecated]].

== Web of Trust ==
No one signed Patrick Schleizer's (adrelanos') key yet. If you're active in the Free Software community and in the vicinity of Leipzig, Germany, please meet up with Patrick Schleizer for key signing.

|description=Using a Tor Controller with Whonix. Arm. Vidalia. Change your Tor circuit. Monitor Tor.
}}

= Tor Controller =

Two options. '''Arm''' or Vidalia. '''Arm''' is already '''pre-installed''' on Whonix and '''recommended'''.

= Vidalia =

'''Not recommended.'''&lt;ref&gt;
{{Anchor|Vidalia_recommended_against}}
Vidalia is recommended against, because:

* Because instructions getting it to work in Whonix have not tested since Whonix 0.1.3. There will probably be no anonymity issues, but the instructions may not work out of the box.
* Vidalia is unmaintained (no one is working on it anymore). Vidalia has been removed from Tor Browser Bundle 3.x by The Tor Project. So this project is pretty much dead anyway.
* Vidalia has issues with controlling Tor, i.e. Vidalia can't stop the Tor which comes from the Debian package, which is started as user &quot;debian-tor&quot;. It also can not edit {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}. Not sure if control commands such as New Idenity are correctly processed (easy to find out).
* Vidalia does not understand obfuscated bridges.
* Which overall makes a pretty bad and confusing user experience. Therefore recommended against.
* However, if it's Vidalia's nice network map you're after, you may be able to get it working.
&lt;/ref&gt; Better use Arm. See below.

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;See [[Vidalia]].&lt;/font&gt;

= Arm =
Since Whonix does not include Vidalia, Arm is '''recommended'''. It's already pre-installed on Whonix-Gateway.

[[Image:screenshot_arm_page1_cropped.png|arm, Tor Controller|thumb]]

To start it, simply type on Whonix-Gateway:

&lt;pre&gt;arm&lt;/pre&gt;

To get a new circuit, press.

}}
[[Image:torbrowser.png|400px|Tor Browser, privacy by design. Fighting web fingerprinting and linkability.|thumb]]
= Introduction =
It is recommended&lt;ref&gt;Reasons? See below.&lt;/ref&gt;, that you use only Tor Browser for browsing the web in Whonix.

Tor Browser&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en&lt;/ref&gt; is a fork&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Mozilla Firefox&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/&lt;/ref&gt; web browser, optimized&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/&lt;/ref&gt; and designed&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/en/design/&lt;/ref&gt; for anonymity, developed by The Tor Project&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/&lt;/ref&gt;. Given Firefox's popularity, many of you have probably used it before and its user interface is like any other modern web browser.

Here are a few things worth mentioning in the context of Whonix.

= Anonymity vs Pseudonymity =
When you were to use other browsers than Tor Browser, your IP/DNS would still be protected by Whonix, but you wouldn't profit from Tor Browser's the protocol level cleanup. Using other browser would be [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous rather than anonymous]].

Tor Browser in comparison to other browser is optimized for anonymity, it contains privacy enhancing patches&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#firefox-patches&lt;/ref&gt; and add-ons&lt;ref&gt;See below.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are no other browsers other than Tor Browser capable of protocol level cleanup. When you use Tor Browser, you will blend in and share the [[Fingerprint]] of other Tor Browser users, which is a good thing.

= HTTPS Encryption =

Using HTTPS instead of HTTP encrypts your communication while browsing the web.

All the data exchanged between your browser and the server you are visiting are encrypted. It prevents the [[Warning#Tor_exit_nodes_can_eavesdrop_on_communications|Tor exit relay to eavesdrop on your communication]].

HTTPS also includes mechanisms to authenticate the server you are communicating with. But those mechanisms can be flawed, [[Warning#Man-in-the-middle_attacks|as explained on our warning page]].

For example, here is how the browser looks like when we try to log in an email account at lavabit.com&lt;ref&gt;http://lavabit.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, using their interface&lt;ref&gt;https://lavabit.com/apps/webmail/src/login.php webmail&lt;/ref&gt;:

[[Image:lavabit.png]]

Notice the small area on the left of the address bar saying &quot;lavabit.com&quot; on a blue background and the address beginning with &quot;https://&quot; (instead of &quot;http://&quot;):

[[Image:address-bar.png]]

These are the indicators that an encrypted connection using HTTPS&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure&lt;/ref&gt; is being used.

You should try to only use services providing HTTPS when you are sending or retrieving sensitive information (like passwords), otherwise it's very easy for an eavesdropper to steal whatever information you are sending or to modify the content of a page on its way to your browser.

= HTTPS Everywhere =

[[Image:https-everywhere.jpg|HTTPS Everywhere logo|thumb]]

HTTPS Everywhere&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere&lt;/ref&gt; is a Firefox extension shipped in Tor Browser and produced as a collaboration between The Tor Project&lt;ref&gt;https://torproject.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;ref&gt;https://eff.org/&lt;/ref&gt;. It encrypts your communications with a number of major websites. Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by rewriting all requests to these sites to HTTPS.

To learn more about HTTPS Everywhere you can see:

* the [https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere HTTPS Everywhere homepage]
* the [https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/faq/ HTTPS Everywhere FAQ]

= Torbutton =

Tor alone is not enough to protect your anonymity and privacy while browsing the web. All modern web browsers, such as Firefox, support JavaScript&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript&lt;/ref&gt;, Adobe Flash&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash&lt;/ref&gt;, cookies&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie&lt;/ref&gt; and other features which have been shown to be able to defeat the anonymity &lt;ref&gt;[[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.]].&lt;/ref&gt; provided by the Tor network.

In Tor Browser all such features are handled from inside the browser, because it's a modified version of Firefox Patches&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers&lt;/ref&gt; and it contains an extension called Torbutton&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/&lt;/ref&gt;. These do all sorts of things to prevent the above type of attacks. But that comes at a price: since this will disable some functionalities and some sites might not work as intended. Don't worry too much about this, the vast majority of websites works very well.

To learn more about Torbutton you can see:

* [https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/ the Torbutton homepage]
* [https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en the Torbutton FAQ]

To learn more about Data Collection Techniques, Fingerprinting you can see:

* [[Data Collection Techniques]]

= Protection against dangerous JavaScript =

Having all JavaScript disabled by default would disable a lot of harmless and possibly useful JavaScript and render unusable many websites. This would scare away lots of potential users &quot;because it just doesn't work&quot;. Torbutton disables all potentially dangerous JavaScript. On the other hand, having a big user base is important for good anonymity as this very interesting mail by Roger Dingledine explains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mail-archive.com/liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu/msg00022.html&lt;/ref&gt;

That's why '''JavaScript is enabled by default''' in Tor Browser. We consider this as a necessary compromise between security and usability and as of today we are not aware of any JavaScript that would compromise Whonix anonymity.

For more technical details you can refer to the Torbutton design document.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/en/design/&lt;/ref&gt; Another related discussion justifying why JavaScript is enabled by default in Tor Browser was on tor-talk, &quot;Tor Browser disabling Javascript anonymity set reduction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024227.html&lt;/ref&gt;

= NoScript =

[[Image:noscript.png|NoScript logo|thumb]]

NoScript also comes with Tor Browser and provides many protections, even thought JavaScript is enabled by default. You shouldn't mess with NoScript settings in Tor Browser unless you exactly know what you are doing.

For more information you can refer to the NoScript [http://noscript.net/ website] and [http://noscript.net/features features].

= Tips =
It [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7255 might] be better not to maximize the Tor Browser window.

= Tor Browser in Whonix differences =
== Introduction ==
The regular Tor Browser Bundle and Tor Browser in Whonix slightly differ. Tor Browser has been slightly modified by Whonix to work behind the Whonix-Gateway. The network and browser fingerprint however, is the same.

Tor Browser's internal update check mechanism is untouched and works fine. Default homepage is untouched and still https://check.torproject.org.

== New Identity Button ==
The New Identity button om Tor Browser isn't perfect yet (NOT a Whonix issue), there are open bugs.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=needs_information&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=keywords&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;keywords=tbb-linkability tbb-linkability] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=needs_revision&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=keywords&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;keywords=tbb-fingerprinting tbb-fingerprinting].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Whonix Proxy Settings ==
'''Short''':
You don't need to change any proxy settings in Tor Browser.

'''Long''':
There is no Tor over Tor in Whonix, which would be [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.|recommended against]].

Whonix 6 and above do not modify Tor Browser's defaults (apart from the start-tor-browser script).

== More than one Tor Browser in Whonix ==
For better isolation of different identities. For advanced users. Moved to the [[Advanced_Security_Guide#More_than_one_Tor_Browser_in_Whonix|Advanced Security Guide]].

= Update Tor Browser =

== Introduction ==

There is no auto-update feature for Tor Browser. You will be notified about new Tor Browser versions by [[whonixcheck]]. Additionally, Tor Browser's built in stock update notification mechanism also works in Whonix. Additionally it might be also wise to subscribe to https://blog.torproject.org for news.

== Updating ==
[[File:Tor Browser Update Check_001.png|Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) checking for updates.|thumb]]
[[File:Tor Browser Update Check_002.png|Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) Update Notification|thumb]]
[[File:Tor Browser Update Check_003.png|Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) downloading.|thumb]]
[[File:Tor Browser Update Check_004.png|Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) update done.|thumb]]
[[File:Tor Browser Update Check_005.png|Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) in Terminal|thumb]]

'''Short''':&lt;br /&gt;
Tor Browser version check and update (after confirmation) in Whonix can be done with:

&lt;pre&gt;update-torbrowser&lt;/pre&gt;

A future update of Tor Browser by The Tor Project might make Tor Browser running in Whonix-Workstation unusable. In case Tor Browser inside Whonix-Workstation breaks, a news with instructions on how to fix the issue will be posted within a few days. If not, the Whonix developers are not aware of the issue.

If the Tor Browser update script is ever broken, you are advised to update manually, see [[Manually_Updating_Tor_Browser]].

'''Long''':&lt;br /&gt;
If you update Tor Browser in Whonix and there won't be [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.|Tor over Tor, which is recommended against]]. You can use either (choose one):

* Whonix's {{Code|update-torbrowser}} which comes with Whonix &lt;ref&gt;Because it patches the start-tor-browser script.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Manually Updating Tor Browser]] instructions

= Browser Plugins / Flash / Java =

See [[Browser Plugins]].

= Browser Language =
If you want the browser interface in a different language than English, see [[Language]].

= Change/Remove Proxy Settings =
'''This is an advanced topic. You most likely only need it for advanced tunneling scenarios.'''

You could either:

* Use Tor Button's -&gt; Preferences to set it to any other proxy or no proxy. {{Code2|Transparent Torification}} means, &quot;no proxy&quot; or in other words it means &quot;use whatever the system system provides&quot;.
* For an alternative method, setting {{Code2|Transparent Torification}} which does not involve Tor Button's graphical user interface, see footnote &lt;ref&gt;
&lt;!--Keeping that, in case Tor Button's settings dialog breaks again.--&gt;
If you want to set it to no proxy, you could either:

* additionally add in ~/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser below &quot;#!/bin/sh&quot;.

&lt;pre&gt;export TOR_TRANSPROXY=1&lt;/pre&gt;

* Or add to /etc/environment

&lt;pre&gt;TOR_TRANSPROXY=1&lt;/pre&gt;

and reboot.
&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Forget about Tor Button's -&gt; Open Network Settings. See footnote, if you want to know why.&lt;ref&gt;
When using the regular Tor Browser Bundle from The Tor Project without Whonix, that menu can be used to change network settings inside Tor. It has the same effects as editing Tor's config file torrc. Using this graphical user interface isn't possible in Whonix, because for security reasons, in Whonix there is only limited access to Tor's control port. (See [[Dev/CPFP]] for more information.) (You could change such settings manually in /etc/tor/torrc on Whonix-Gateway. (See also [[Features#VPN_.2F_Tunnel_support|VPN/Tunnel suppprt]] for more information.)

|description=Design Documentation of Whonix's Time Synchronization Mechanism
}}
[[Image:timesync_gui.png|TimeSync (Whonix) done|thumb]]

= Basic Knowledge =
== Introduction ==
The Post Install Advice is part of this design, therefore read [[Post Install Advice#Network Time Syncing|Network Time Syncing]] first. Also read the Advanced Security Guide chapter [[Advanced Security Guide#Network Time Synchronization|Network Time Synchronization]] as well.

== VirtualBox's time synchronization features ==
For understanding Whonix's Time Synchronization Mechanism, it is required to know VirtualBox's time synchronization features:

* VirtualBox uses the host's time if it needs to correct the time for guests.
* (Some of VirtualBox's time synchronization features depend on guest additions.)
* By default VirtualBox corrects Virtual Machine guests' virtual hardware system clock,
** when they get powered on,
** when they resume from suspension and
** when their clock is more than X minutes off.

== Facts ==
People have been using:

* Tor Browser and Mozilla Firefox in parallel
* Tails inside VMs and Firefox on the host
* Tor Browser inside Whonix-Workstation and Mozilla Firefox on the host

== Other Facts ==
* Almost no one and no operating system is using Secure Network Time Synchronization or External Clocks by default. Most systems synchronize the system clock using unauthenticated NTP. An adversary tampering with NTP replies or malicious NTP server makes things even worse. Even if there was authenticated NTP, there is a requirement for a distributed trust model.
* A system not using NTP or using authenticated NTP stands out from most other users.

== Definitions ==
* Time Sanity Check in context of Whonix: Is an init.d script, which checks if the system clock is between build timestamp and expiration date (17 MAY 2033 10:00:00).

== NTP authentication (autokey) is insecure ==
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ntp-network-time-security-00
* http://www.innovationslab.net/~brian/NTP/autokey-analysis.pdf

== curl timeout ==
[https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-February/002635.html Tails-dev Endless Data Attack and Defense]

= Attacks =
A correct system clock is crucial for many reasons (see footnotes for more):

* '''Attack 1:''' Replay attacks &lt;ref&gt;Replay old Tor consensus, see [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing/ Tails: Time syncing] for detailed explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Attack 2:''' Feeding old/outdated/known vulnerable updates and (https) certificates &lt;ref&gt;Cryptographic verification depends on system clock, i.e. a clock two years in past will accept certificates/updates, which have been expired/revoked for two years.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Attack 3:''' Deanonymizing &lt;ref&gt;Javascript is enabled in Tor Button by default and it can be used to read the client's clock, see http://ip-check.info for demonstration. Also other applications do leak the client's clock, such as Thunderbird (patch has been proposed by TorBirdy developers) and https. Imagine the user connects to an adversary controlled web-server with Mozilla Firefox and connects to another web-server controlled by the same adversary with Tor Browser. As long as TBB upstream [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3059 Bug #3059: Find some way to deal with time-based fingerprints] is open, the adversary can link the anonymous and non-anonymous session, thus deanonymizing.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Attack 4:''' Linking all sessions to the same pseudonym &lt;ref&gt;If the clock is too much off, it's also easy for an adversary's web-server to detect &quot;Oh, that's the Tor Browser user who's clock is X in past/future.&quot;, thus allowing the adversary to link all sessions to the same pseudonym. See Tor Browser upstream bug #3059: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3059 Find some way to deal with time-based fingerprints].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Attack 5:''' Locating hidden services. &lt;ref&gt;For hidden services a correct clock is crucial, see: [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/ccs06hotornot.pdf Hot or Not: Revealing Hidden Services by their Clock Skew]; [http://caia.swin.edu.au/talks/CAIA-TALK-080728A.pdf An improved clock-skew measurement technique for revealing hidden services]; [http://people.cs.umass.edu/~elisha/Papers/SkewMask%20-%20final%20version.pdf SkewMask: Frustrating Clock Skew Fingerprinting Attempts]&lt;/ref&gt;

= Whonix's Time Synchronization Mechanism =
== Overview ==
* Whonix leaves the host's system clock or time synchronization mechanism untouched.
* Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation are based on VirtualBox and therefore have their own virtual hardware system clocks.
* Most VirtualBox time synchronization features get disabled by Whonix.
** Guest additions time synchronization gets disabled in ''/etc/init.d/htpdate'' at run time. See VirtualBox bug report [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10828 VBoxService --disable-timesync broken]. They say it's actually not a bug. It's a missing feature, that running instances of VBoxService can not be modified in their settings. Whonix would need to edit ''/etc/init.d/vboxadd-service'' by adding ''--disable-timesync'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/2928 source]&lt;/ref&gt;. Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer does not see a reliable way to do so. If the guest additions get automatically updated in future the option would get overwritten. That's why Whonix added a line in ''/etc/init.d/htpdate'' to turn it off completely. Guest additions time synchronization gets disabled, but the rest of the guest additions continue to work fine. Unless you have a better idea, it's an acceptable workaround.
** built in time synchronization features get disabled by ''VBoxManage setextradata &quot;$VMNAME&quot; &quot;VBoxInternal/Devices/VMMDev/0/Config/GetHostTimeDisabled&quot; &quot;1&quot;'' at build time.
* Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation
** When get powered on, they still get their time from the host. The user is advised to modify the biossystemtimeoffset in Advanced Security Guide, chapter [[Advanced Security Guide#Network Time Synchronization|Network Time Synchronization]]. &lt;ref&gt;Developer information: If we needed or wanted to render the hardware clock unusable, we could set VirtualBox ''--biossystemtimeoffset'' several decades in past or future.&lt;/ref&gt;
** {{Whonix6}} and above: Time Sanity Check before sdwdate will be executed, this ensures, that the host clock is sane and not slow in 1980. User gets advised to fix its host clock in such cases.
** After they are connected to the Tor network, they use sdwdate (inspired by [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing/ tails_htp]) to set the system clock. &lt;ref&gt;Stream isolation has been added, for Whonix's sdwdate implementation i.e. people using Tor Browser prevent notifying their exit relay, that they are sdwdate or Whonix users.&lt;/ref&gt;
** {{Whonix6}} and above: Time Sanity Check after sdwdate was executed. This should catch eventual bigger bugs and attacks. User gets informed if it fails.
* On Whonix-Workstation,
** Using Boot Clock Randomization (Whonix {{Whonix6}} and above), i.e. after boot, the clock is set randomly between 5 and 180 seconds into the past or future. This is useful to enforce the design goal, that the host clock and Whonix-Workstation clock should always slightly differ. It's also useful to obfuscate the clock when sdwdate itself is running, because naturally at this time, sdwdate hasn't finished.
** Every hour, at a random time, sdwdate will set the clock again. This is useful for machines running for long time periods without reboot.
** An adversary could guess if someone is running a hidden service with constant clock adjustments, that it's hosted inside a Whonix-Workstation. It's unknown if the clock adjustments by sdwdate are big enough to enable an adversary to guess that.
*** '''TODO''': Open question... &quot;''ntpd adjusts the clock in small steps so that the timescale is effectively continuous and without discontinuities''&quot; - is that possible with a sdwdate like approach as well?
* Whonix-Gateway
** Doesn't use Boot Clock Randomization. If the assumption is correct, that the ISP can detect clock jumps by observing Tor's TLS client hello, clock jumps should be avoided to prevent fingerprinting Whonix users.
** Uses sdwdate after booting.
** Using it at all is better against Attack (1) when using a bridge.
** Running sdwdate also every \[1440 minutes + random(0-1440)\]. Not running this every hour at a random time, because Tor does not like clock jumps. When testing this, there were cases where the clock jumped about 800 seconds, which caused Tor to expire circuits, which caused connection interrupts.
** '''TODO''': Open question... How often should sdwdate run on Whonix-Gateway? Every hour is a bad idea, as we see above. Not running it again when some people may run Whonix-Gateway for days or weeks is not good either, since the clock can drift. Maybe it should run wait 24 hours and then wait a random amount of minutes within 24 hours?
*** The entry guard or bridge can see the time through TCP timestamp. &lt;ref name=tlsleakone&gt;[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7277 torproject.org #7277: timestamp leaked in TLS client hello]&lt;/ref&gt;; &lt;ref name=tlsleaktwo&gt;[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4852 torproject.org #4852: Clients send NETINFO with time]&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Continuous clock jumps could help the entry guard or bridge guessing, that a Whonix-Gateway is connected.
*** '''TODO''': Open question... &quot;''ntpd adjusts the clock in small steps so that the timescale is effectively continuous and without discontinuities''&quot; - is that possible with a sdwdate like approach as well?
* Hardware Clock:
** Whonix-Gateway: set to UTC. Tor leaks it &lt;ref name=tlsleakone /&gt;; &lt;ref name=tlsleaktwo /&gt;, but that is of no concern. Tor is running on Linux and Linux is expected to be run in UTC. Therefore there is no point to set it to the local time zone of the user.
** Whonix-Workstation: set to UTC
* sdwdate runs at non-predictable times to prevent the ISP or Tor guard/bridge node to guess, that the user is running Whonix.
* Implementation details are in Design-Shared, chapter [[Dev/Design-Shared#timesync|TimeSync]]
* That will reach the design goal, that all clocks, the host's, Whonix-Gateway's and Whonix-Workstation's slightly differ.

== sdwdate ==
=== Authentication of Servers ===
The custom /usr/bin/sdwdate we use only connects to HTTPS servers, and delegates TLS X.509 certificate verification to curl. It also uses several different pools of time sources, and if there are too many that fail for any given pool, e.g. because of failed certificate checking or being unreachable, the pool is considered to be potentially compromised and sdwdate aborts.

curl is also directed to only use TLSv1 as a &quot;secure&quot; protocol.

=== sdwdate source pools ===
What sources should be trusted? This is of course also a problem with NTP.

The sdwdate pools used by Whonix are based on stable and reliable webservers that get great amounts of traffic. They are categorized into three different pools according to their members' relationship to the members in the other pools; any member in a one pool should be unlikely to share logs (or other identifying data), or to agree to send fake time information, with a member from the the other pools. The pools are as follows:

* The &quot;pal&quot; pool are run by groups that are likely to take great care of their visitors' privacy.
* The &quot;foe&quot; pool are managed by adversaries of the &quot;pal&quot; pool.
* The &quot;neutral&quot; pool members have a neutral raltionship to both the &quot;pal&quot; and &quot;foe&quot; pool.

The pools are listed in {{Code2|whonix_shared/etc/sdwdate.d/30_sdwdate_default}}.

Basically, sdwdate picks three random servers - one from each pool, and then builds the mediate of the three advertised dates.

= Conclusions =
* '''Attack 1''' is a general Tor problem. It is impossible to solve for Whonix. It is unsolved in other projects as well.
* '''Attack 2''' gets partially defeated.
** Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation are immune.
** This problem is unsolved in other projects as well.
*** This is a general problem with all operating systems.
*** The host is still at risk.
*** [http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/30050/ Ubuntu Brainstorm Idea #30050: Secure Network Time Synchronization]
*** [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=%23687166 Debian Bug Report ntp: NTP security vulnerability because not using authentication by default]
*** [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/+bug/1039420 Ubuntu Bug Report NTP security vulnerability because not using authentication by default]
** Manual workaround: Check your clock manually and read [[Other Operating Systems#About_Ubuntu|About Ubuntu]] (stale mirror attack). ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/716535 Bug #716535: Please support Valid-Until in release files for security.ubuntu.com])
* '''Attack 3''' gets defeated, Whonix adds additional security.
* '''Attack 4''' gets defeated, Whonix adds additional security.
* '''Attack 5''' is a general Tor problem, which can not be solved by Whonix and which is unsolved in other projects as well. Since host, Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation time all differ, this attack at least becomes harder against Whonix.

When the user powers on Whonix-Gateway and the host time is too much off, it will not be able to connect to the Tor network. It is advised, when powering on Whonix-Gateway, to check that the host time is no more than 1 hour in past or more than 3 hour in future. Otherwise Tor will be unable to connect.&lt;ref&gt;https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-February/023264.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An adversary tampering with the user's clock, while the user doesn't recognize that, can't do any more damage to Whonix than he could do to the Tor Browser Bundle. Worst case is a denial of service for Tor. On the other hand, an adversary capable of actively tampering with the traffic between the user and its entry guard or bridge poses much bigger risks to Tor in general. &lt;ref&gt;General Tor problems, Tor is known to be broken against many active attacks. This can not be solved by Whonix. When an adversary is capable of running active attacks, tampering with the time leading into a denial of service is the least of the worries. The adversary could also disrupt the service easier. And as for active attacking in general, there are other attacks which are easier to deploy and which pose a greater danger. Not a Whonix specific problem.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reason for running TimeSync on Whonix-Gateway, is that hidden services can only be accessed if the clock is no more than 30 minutes slow or fast.&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3582#comment:3&lt;/ref&gt; Running TimeSync ensures, that Whonix-Gateway's clock is reasonably accurate.

= External Clock =
This topic is still under research. Help is welcome.

It might make sense to add an external clock, such as a GPS, or even better an atomic clock. (Can we get an atomic USB clock?) This clock should be added to the host and/or Whonix-Gateway and/or Whonix-Workstation?

Open question: would the GPS/atomic clock be too accurate and would that make Whonix more fingerprintable?

Virtual machines can provide following security related features:

* Network isolation (connections can easily be forced through tor)
* Hardware isolation (hide unique hardware serials)
* Roll back feature
* Cheap and simple multi-level security through running multiple clones/VMs

Live CDs offer:

* Non-persistence in case of software compromises
* Anti-Forensics and deniability (no encryption keys to disclose, if it's powered down and RAM is wiped/faded everything is &quot;gone&quot;)
* But: difficult to roll out security updates

Footnotes:

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; See forum topic [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/05abffad/ More or Less Protection inside a VM?] for some more discussion. 

== Related to Operating System ==

Multiple options for operating system.

* Debian Wheezy GNU/Linux (Default-Download-Version, recommended!).
* See also [[Other Operating Systems]], especially [[Other Operating Systems#Security_Comparison:_Whonix-Download-Workstation_vs._Whonix-Custom-Workstation | Security Comparison: Whonix-Download-Workstation vs. Whonix-Custom-Workstation]]
* Any other, see ''Whonix Framework''.
* There is [[HardenedGentooTG | Hardened Gentoo based Whonix-Gateway]]. (outdated, experts only, needs maintainer!)

== Security Comparison: Whonix-Download-Workstation vs. Whonix-Custom-Workstation ==

See [[Other Operating Systems#Security_Comparison:_Whonix-Download-Workstation_vs._Whonix-Custom-Workstation | Security Comparison: Whonix-Download-Workstation vs. Whonix-Custom-Workstation]].

Unless otherwise stated, the documentation and design is about the Default-Download-Version.

|description=Deprecated instructions for how to use Whonix with only one Virtual Machine.
}}

= OLD =

'''OneVM is deprecated. It was tested and developed for 0.1.3. The concept worked. It's deprecated now, because it has no maintainer.'''

= Introduction =

Whonix needs at least two systems, one running Tor, the other running clients that are routed through Tor. This ensures the highest possible security and isolation. We can implement this using different strategies: Two VMs (Gateway VM and Workstation VM) or bare metal. A different approach is to use a host running Tor and only a single client VM. This site will guide you through all required steps to set up a One VM Whonix. If anything remains unclear please refer to the more verbose How To.

Advantages:

* One VM less required.
* One operating system less required.
* Less system resources required.

Disadvantages:

* Much more difficult to develop, deploy and test for the many different host operating systems.
* Difficult to develop a download version. Could be only an installer, which had to comply with the differences in different host operating systems.
* Guest VM can see MAC address of host?

= Host preparation =

Install Ubuntu 12.04.

You should choose &quot;user&quot; as your username (you can also add such a user if you already installed Ubuntu). Otherwise you need to edit the script (see PREREQUISITES/ASSUMPTIONS #4). You can ignore the ASSUMPTION #2, the -onevm option will configure a virtual internal interface called vnet0.

Get the shell script and run it on the host

&lt;pre&gt;sudo Whonix-Gateway -onevm&lt;/pre&gt;

Download or build the Whonix-Workstation image. # VirtualBox settings for Whonix-Workstation #

Go to Devices &gt; Network Adapter. Make sure all network adapters except Adapter 1 are disabled. Set Adapter one according to following options: (IMPORTANT!)

Attached to: Bridged Adapter Name: vnet0 Click OK.

= Guest VM configuration =

Follow instructions for Whonix-Workstation in [[Dev/Build Documentation]].

Run as root (sudo -i) directly on the workstation (since you need to set up networking ssh can't be used):

&lt;pre&gt;
ifdown -a

echo &quot;
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
# increment last octet (the ...0.2) on additional workstations
address 172.16.0.2
   netmask 255.255.255.0
   network 172.16.0.0
   broadcast 172.16.0.255
   gateway 172.16.0.1&quot; | tee -a /etc/network/interfaces

chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf
echo &quot;nameserver 172.16.0.1&quot; | tee /etc/resolv.conf
chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf
ifup -a&lt;/pre&gt;

|description=Abandoned Draft for a Hardened Genntoo Based Whonix-Gateway. Looking for developer.
}}

= DRAFT! =

'''Draft! Development for Hardened Gentoo based Whonix-Gateway stalled. Debian based gateway still under active development and other operating systems are being considered.'''

= How to create a Hardened Gentoo based Whonix-Gateway =

== Overview ==

* Perhaps useful? http://www.securix.org/

* Install Gentoo build environment (how-to is for installation in a chroot but you can also use a full gentoo installation)
* Build Whonix-Gateway kernel and userland
* Install on media/export to iso/ova (TODO)

Advantages/disadvantages compared to the default Debian/Ubuntu based T-G:

* Updating is much more complicated:
* You need to keep a build system around, keep that updated using emerge-webrsync &amp;&amp; emerge --update --newuse --deep -av world (and probably etc-update)
* you need to update the t-g system on the build system (append --update --newuse --deep to that long emerge command [/Dev/HardenedGentooTG#BuildWhonix-Gatewayenvironment below])
* you need to build new kernels manually
* then you need to copy the new files over your current installation (simple but inefficient: 'cd path/to/torgateway &amp;&amp; tar zcvf update.tgz .' extract: 'tar xvzpf update.tgz')
* emerge is not apt-get, updates often require a bit of manual configuration, review /var/log/portage/elog/summary.log
* Grsec, full pie, no RBAC (hardly necessary considering the threat model of the gateway), no disk encryption, no RAM wipe on shutdown (help would be welcome). When not using hidden services, tor log and cache files can be put into tmpfs so we don't need FDE at all. Otherwise we can still use partial disk encryption (loop file or /var). Evil maid attacks apply anyway as long as there's an unencryped /boot (and BIOS, and firmware...) and no TPM.
* Size: &lt;50 MB compressed.

* disable ipv6
* save to disable (always depending on hardware)
* pci express, pcmcia
* wifi, bluetooth
* amateur radio, RF
* RAID/LVM
* AGP graphics

mkdir /mnt/target
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/target

# edit according to partition and disc layout! sda/sdb/hd are just examples!
# The /dev/sd* name will probably be different on your build system and on your target     system.
# in this example the host got two hard disks, you install to the second one, &quot;sdb&quot;
# this drive is attached to the gateway system and if it's the only drive it becomes &quot;sda&quot;
# same goes for grub: hd1 == sdb, hd0 == sda

echo &quot;
title TorGateway
root (hd0,0)

## outside the chroot (open a new terminal on the host)
cd gentoodev
rsync -a dev/ torgateway/dev/
rm -r torgateway/var/db/* torgateway/tmp/*
rsync -a torgateway/ /mnt/target/

## then, inside the target-chroot

grub
# then manually configure:
# grub&gt; root (hd1,0)
# grub&gt; setup (hd1)

# alternatively, may not work properly
#grub-install --no-floppy /dev/sdb --recheck

exit #target-chroot

|description=Introduction into Whonix's Technical Design.
}}
== Introduction ==

Whonix aims to be safer than Tor alone. The main goal is, that no one can find out the user's IP and location.

The basic idea is, that all applications are untrustworthy. No application must be able to obtain the user's real external IP. Whonix ensures that applications can only connect through Tor. Direct connections (leaks) must be impossible. This is the only way we know of, that can reliably protect your anonymity from client application vulnerabilities and IP/DNS and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Protocolleaks protocol leaks].&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

Whonix consists of two machines, which are connected through an isolated network. One machine acts as the client or ''Whonix-Workstation'', the other as a proxy or ''Whonix-Gateway'', which will route all of the Whonix-Workstation's traffic through Tor. This setup can be implemented either through virtualization and/or Physical Isolation (explained below).

{{TorifiedGateway}}

The '''Whonix Concept''' (see below) is agnostic about everything, the anonymizer, platform, etc. See '''Whonix Framework''' below.

'''Whonix Example Implementation''': Anonymity setup built around '''Tor''', two virtual machines using '''VirtualBox''' and '''Debian GNU/Linux'''. Whonix can be installed on every computer capable of running [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads VirtualBox]. (Supports Windows, OS X, Linux, BSD and Solaris.)

Physical Isolation describes installing Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation on two different pieces of hardware. It is more secure than virtual machines alone, requires more physical space, hardware and electricity costs are higher. Keep in mind that you don't need very powerful dedicated servers or desktops. For more information, see [[Physical Isolation]].

See [[Design]] for Technical Design and security of Whonix. For security introduction, see below.

The listed [[Features]], advantages and disadvantages shall give you an overview, what Whonix is useful for, what Whonix can do for you, and what not.

== Whonix Framework ==

The '''Whonix Concept''' is agnostic about everything. With some development effort you can replace any component. The Whonix developers would like to support each and any use case, but due to limited amount of developers this is impossible and we focus on the '''Whonix Example Implementation'''.

The Tor network is Whonix's official and best supported anonymizing network. Whonix can also potentially and optionally use [[OtherAnonymizingNetworks|other anonymizing networks]] (Such as JonDo, i2p, Freenet, RetroShare), either in addition (tunneled through Tor) or as a replacement for Tor. See the article for more information.

You can also avoid using virtualization by using [[Physical Isolation]] without any virtualization, although that is not recommended, see [[Comparison of different Whonix variants‎]] for more information.

It's possible to use other virtualization platforms than VirtualBox, e.g. Qubes OS, VMware, KVM, XEN, Qemu, Bochs, etc. (See [[Dev/Other Virtualization Platforms]].). Only highly experimental support for [[VMware]] is available as a proof of concept.

Other operating systems (e.g. Windows; *nix; BSD; etc.) can potentially be used as host and/or guest operating system. See the [[Other Operating Systems]] for more information.

== Whonix Concept ==

Whonix is an [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy Isolating Proxy] with an additional [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy Transparent Proxy], which can be optionally disabled. (See [[Stream Isolation]]).

== Security Overview ==

=== In layman's terms ===

Shut up or put up! Adrelanos, is Whonix safe?

It is in the nature of security related software, that there is no 100% safety. Believe it or not, I use it myself and I keep maintaining and developing it. I believe in some aspects, threat models and use cases Whonix is safer than other tools. There is detailed reasoning for my claims on the Whonix Homepage.

If you are more paranoid or have higher security needs, read everything, full documentation and full technical design, you'll learn about physical isolation and build Whonix from source code and so on.

And no, Whonix [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/featureblog/2013/01/another-statement-on-wakingtimescom-news-article-how-to-evade-government-surveillance-and-stay-anonymous-online---mailed-wakingtimescom/ does '''not''' claim] to protect from very powerful adversaries, to be a perfectly secure system, to provide strong anonymity, or to provide protection from three-letter agencies or government surveillance and such.

See also [[Warning#Whonix_is_a_work_in_progress|Whonix is a work in progress]].

At first glance this site may create the impression that Whonix is completely insecure and everything is a lost cause. We are upfront with things we could do better and we are still working on and try to consider all possibilities and document all thinkable and future threats. You must judge for your own which risks are acceptable for your use cases.

=== With more technical terms ===

It's difficult to write a summary of Whonix security features. Both anonymity and security consist of so many different aspects. That's why there is lots of [[Documentation]] and the whole Technical [[Design]].

The Technical [[Design]] intends to document security philosophy, design, goals and current shortcomings of Whonix.

This chapter is only a short introduction. Please read the full [[Design]].

Whonix follows the principle of security by isolation. We know that making our currently used systems secure is a lost cause. They are too complex and too large to be trustworthy and verifiably free of any bugs. Whonix can't solve this but it tries to minimize attack surfaces and limit what danger exploitable bugs in more exposed parts can do, one primary danger specific to Tor is the danger of exposing the public IP address of a system. Whonix isolates client applications inside the Whonix-Workstation from discovering the external IP address. Specifically, Whonix is designed to prevent direct detection of the IP (not more!) even if an adversary has unrestricted access to the Whonix-Workstation.

Once there is a vulnerability found in Tor (ex: exploiting Tor's ports) or a successful attack against Tor, Whonix fails.

Same goes for iptables. Whonix is a setup based on Linux, iptables, Tor, etc. If any of the underlying projects has a vulnerability, which we can not rule out, of course, Whonix will fail as well.

In summary, Whonix does '''not''' claim to be a perfectly secure system, does '''not''' claim to provide anonymity if one faces are very powerful adversary such as various three-letter agencies, governments and so on.

There are [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#OverviewaboutdifferentmethodsforTorification three ways to torify]. Read the link for a comparison of the security.

Whonix-Workstation has no access to the internet without going through Tor. You can look into our setup. It's all Open Source and well documented.

Whonix uses multiple security layers.

# IP-forwarding is disabled.
# IPv6 is disabled.
# The firewall fails &quot;closed&quot;: when Tor is disabled, loses connection, or the Whonix-Gateway crashes, no network connections are possible.
# Iptables redirects any traffic from Whonix-Workstation to Tor's ports. Local network connections are dropped. No leaks are possible, assuming the TCB is trustworthy.
# Applications are configured correctly using latest suggestions (correct application and proxy and other privacy settings, [[Stream Isolation]]).
# Firewall rules are enforced and prevent accessing the internet directly, thus leaks are prevented in case some application leaks.
# Optionally, [[Physical Isolation]] is documented.
# [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].
# [[TimeSync|Whonix's Secure And Distributed Time Synchronization Mechanism]].
# Check.torproject.org is checked (see [[whonixcheck]]) anyway, even though we are sure, that there are no leaks.
# Built in update notification for operating system updates, Tor Browser version and Whonix version (see [[whonixcheck]]).
# Comprehensive, growing [[Documentation]].
# Comprehensive, growing [[Design|Technical Design]].
# Openness about weaknesses, shortcomings, etc.
# Cryptographically signed binary builds and git source code tags.
# ...

Whonix was tested for leaks, see [[Dev/Leak Tests]]. All went negative. Additionally, Skype, which is known for it's ability to punch through firewalls, was not able to establish non-torified connections. Also BitTorrent doesn't leak the IP (there is an online bittorrent leak tester), which of course should never be used through Tor (because it chokes Tor nodes), but for leak testing it was welcome. Right now we don't know of any leak tests which leaks the real IP.

Whonix is safe (not affected) from [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Protocolleaks Protocol leaks], like this the ones listed on [[Security in Real World]], Skype, Flash or BitTorrent. This already justifies to use a &quot;no non-Tor connections possible&quot; approach.

When you go ahead now, and ask in a cracker forum, they probably won't spread a simple method to get the real IP of Whonix-Workstation. On the other hand, if you run an intelligence service and have 100.000 $ left over, you can announce something like &quot;find a new exploit in Tor's SocksPort and get 100.000 $&quot;. Qualified people start looking into it and might find something.

|description=Discussion about Download Security of Software.
}}
= General =
The [[#Simple|Simple]] chapter tries to keep it as short and easy as possible while the [[#More difficult|More difficult]] chapter goes more into detail, reasoning and theory.

= Simple =
There is no digital security like 0 or 1 or insecure or secure. The message of this page is, the more inconvenience one is willing to take and the more time one invests, the more security one can gain.

Just downloading the images in the clear without any verification is the least safe method. On the other hand, how insecure is it? There is for example [http://www.gpg4win.org/ gpg4win], [http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable Firefox Portable] and so on. There is no SSL available when downloading those software projects. If you compare how often software gets downloaded and how few times the accompanying signatures are downloaded, very few people do care. Yet, reports of downloads which got compromised by a man-in-the-middle attack (for any project) happen seldom.

Sourceforge.net does not support SSL for downloads.

Viewing the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/files/current sourceforge download page] while logged into sourceforge.net you can see the MD5 and SHA1 hash (provided by sourceforge.net, not Whonix developers) after clicking the '''i''' button (View details). There is also a SHA1 hash integrated into the magnet link on the [[Download#Download_Whonix|Download page]] (provides by Whonix developers).

Comparing the hash sums from the SSL protected page and verifying (comparing them) with what was downloaded is safer than no verification at all.

OpenPGP verification (as noted on the [[Download]] page) is much more safe and highly recommended.

Building Whonix from source code is the most secure option to obtain Whonix. (Many bonus points for auditing the source code before using it.)

* [[Trust]]
* [[Whonix Signing Key]]

= More difficult =
Of course, providing downloadable images over SSL and/or a hidden service hosted by Whonix developers in a physically owned and protected place would be safer. Practically it is difficult to provide SSL protected downloads at all. Many important software projects can only be downloaded in the clear, such as Ubuntu, Debian, Tails, Qubes OS, etc. This is because someone has to pay the bill and SSL (encryption) makes it more expensive. At the moment we happen to have at least one mirror supporting SSL. Unsure how long it will last. We're also still looking for more SSL supported mirrors to share the load.

The SSL CA system being flawed in the first place is another story (see [[SSL]]).

Having SSL supported mirrors may seem like an oxymoron. The common practice is to say, that mirrors are not to be trusted. Even if the mirror owners were trusted persons, it's still an open question how good their server security is. And even if their server security is good, mirrors are generally also hosted in hosting companies and we can't trust those. However, not all adversaries have share all available capabilities. Not all adversaries capable of mounting a man-in-the-middle attack are capable of breaking server security or forcing the hosting company to turn over the keys etc. Users not caring to use verification are still better off downloading from a SSL supported mirror, that works against less sophisticated adversaries. In numbers, this results in fewer users potentially ending up with maliciously altered downloads, so we think this is worth going for.

It would also be safer if the download server would be under full control of the developers and not under control of a big company (hosting provider). But that's not how things work today. Self-hosting is very expensive. (Requires fast internet connection, home user contracts won't be fast enough, many servers, electricity power and physical security (officers).) Even the servers of The Tor Project are not hosted in some developer's home.

Building from source code is also safer, because the developer itself does not have to be trusted. Even if the developer was trusted, self building is still safer. It removes the risk, that the developer's build machine getting infected by a targeted attack. See also, [[Trust]].

|description=Comparison of anonymizers considered for the implementation of the Anonymous Operating System Whonix.
}}

== Introduction ==

This page describes, why Tor was chosen for the ''Whonix Example Implementation'' as anonymity network and also discussed alternatives, which also have been considered.

== Tor ==

Tor has been chosen for the ''Whonix Example Implementation'', because it's the best researched and most used network. Whonix developer adrelanos believes Tor is currently the most secure anonymity network legally available to most users. See [http://freehaven.net/anonbib/ anonbib] for a collection about research papers about Tor and other anonymity networks.

Many users are important, because you can only be anonymous within a big group of people. More secure networks exist in theory, such as the mixminion high latency network, but without enough users, in practice they are less secure. See [http://www.mail-archive.com/liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu/msg00022.html Roger Dingledine explanation] for details.

On the [[Warning]] page are some shortcomings of Tor listed.

== Whonix and other Anonymity Networks ==

The ''Whonix Framework'' is agnostic about the Anonymity Network being used. In theory also Tor could be completely exchanged with any other suited anonymizing network, see [[Dev/Technical Introduction#Whonix Framework|Whonix Framework]]. Development in this area stalled due to lack of interest from users, upstream developers and Whonix developers. Anyway, there has been some research, theoretical and practical work done towards such integration, see [[Dev/Inspiration]] in case you are interested.

== Security considerations ==

Any successful attacks against Tor, does also work against Whonix and will result in a compromise of location/identity. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Whonix does not try to defend against network attacks, like a massive amount of evil Tor nodes, end-to-end correlation attacks and so on. The Tor software package from the Debian repository is installed in Whonix. There are no modifications to Tor software. This is left to the Tor developers and Debian packagers.

If TransPort, DnsPort or SocksPort, which Whonix heavily relies on, can be exploited, then it's also game over.

There is no known bug (or &quot;feature&quot;) to obtain the users real IP address through either SocksPort, TransPort or DnsPort. If there were such a bug found in the future, which is possible, it would be a major bug in Tor. We would hope, that the Tor developers fix that bug. We hope that compile time hardening features will be added. [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5210 Bug #5210: Enable gcc and ld hardening by default in 0.2.3.x] has been fixed. [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5024 Bug #5024: compile time hardening of TBB (RELRO, canary, PIE)] is still open.

There are other attacks thinkable, which we can not defend against. For example, if an adversary controls your entry node or can observe your ISP and has access to the Whonix-Workstation. He can simply use &quot;morse&quot; (5 seconds much traffic, 10 seconds no traffic...) And then observe it's incoming connections. Then it's game over as well.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Unless Tor is combined with other means of anonymization (available as optional feature). 

== Other Anonymity Networks reviewed for Whonix ==

=== High latency networks ===

In theory, high latency networks would be safer than Tor. Unfortunately there is no high latency network, with enough users, which is well designed, developed and maintained.

=== AdvOR ===

Not suited for Whonix at all.

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/advtor/ AdvOR], the &quot;Advanced&quot; Onion Router is not suited for Whonix. Reasons:

* No interest from the research community.
* No source control, i.e. git.
* Licensing issues (See Nick Mathewson's (Tor's Chief Architect) analysis below.)
* Absence in the Tor community.
* No Linux support.
* Whonix developer believes the Tails developers and the Tor developers to be modest and genuine. Doing their best on providing fine software. They generally work thoroughly, come to, in adrelanos opinion, clever conclusions. A Tails developer and a Tor developer wrote about AdvOR. Adrelanos believes it's best not to summarize the their writings. Please read it yourself, in case you're interested.
** [https://tails.boum.org/forum/Facebook_doesn__39__t_block_a_profile_if_logged_into_thru_AdvOR/#comment-6a1f9df007aadf7126f5b2420f02c11e Answer from a Tails developer about AdvOR].
** The [http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2010/msg00026.html Nick Mathewson's (Tor's Chief Architect) analysis] and recommends against.
* In adrelanos opinion: less safe than Tor.

=== i2p ===

==== Review ====
It is not possible to reliably replace the Tor network with the [http://www.i2p2.de i2p network] for Whonix-Gateway. The i2p network is mainly designed to host all services inside the i2p network. We have to update the Whonix-Workstation's operating system and software packages. That is not possible with i2p. Outproxies existed in past (http, https and socks), but too few of them. And they are not suited for use with Whonix. They are too unreliable (too often offline). At time of writing the i2p chapter (March 2012) there where no working https or socks outproxies, which we could use for apt-get.

i2p can only be used as an addition to Whonix (tunnel ip2 over Tor).

Even if there where enough reliable outproxies, there is one question which would have to be answered. Is i2p designed for withholding the external IP from a Workstation, i.e. does the i2p webinterface spill the external IP and if yes, can it be configured, not to?

There was [[Dev/Inspiration#i2p|development idea]] to install Tor and optionally i2p on Whonix-Gateway, but stalled due to lack from Whonix developers and i2p community.

That i2p is not in Debian package sources would also make integration harder.

* [http://trac.i2p2.de/ticket/726 i2p users can be deanonymized using browser fingerprinting]. ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EQgYfFNf w])
* [http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2013-June/004580.html About i2p insecurity]

==== Summary ====

Not suited for Whonix for the Default-Download-Version.

* No out proxies at the moment. (Can not connect to any servers outside the i2p network. i2p is much different than Tor.) Clearnet websites could not be reached, apt-get wouldn't work, etc.
* Less interest from the research community.
* No interest from the i2p community.
* In adrelanos opinion: less safe than Tor.

=== JonDonym ===

Not suited for Whonix for the Default-Download-Version.

This JonDonym chapter is a summary of the [[Dev/Inspiration#JonDonym|JonDonym]] chapter from the &quot;Inspiration&quot; page, which is about adding an option to Whonix to use JonDonym instead of Tor and a summary of the [[JonDonym]] introduction chapter, which reflects adrelanos's opinion about the JonDonym network security.

* Less interest from the research community.
* Too less help (interest?) from upstream developers to create a JonDoBOX (See [[Dev/Inspiration#JonDonym|JonDonym]] chapter from the &quot;Inspiration&quot; page.).
* Free version too limited.
* In adrelanos opinion: less safe than Tor.

=== VPN ===

Not suited for Whonix for the Default-Download-Version. This is a summary of [[Comparison_Of_Tor_Proxies_CGI_proxies_Proxy_Chains_And_VPN_Services#Comparison_of_Tor_and_VPN_services|Comparison of Tor and VPN services]].

* Fail open, which is bad. Ok, that could be prevented using [[VPN-Firewall]] or even better developing/using a VPN-Gateway.
* No distributed trust, just a single trusted provider.
* Affected by identity correlation.
* No free ones without restrictions.
* In adrelanos opinion: less safe than Tor.

=== Freenet ===

Not suited for Whonix for the Default-Download-Version.

Replacing Tor with Freenet is impossible, as Freenet is a separated network, not designed to exit the network, i.e. clearnet websites could not be reached, apt-get wouldn't work, etc.

There was a [[Dev/Inspiration#Freenet|development idea]] to install Tor and optionally Freenet on Whonix-Gateway. It would pose the questions. Is Freenet designed for withholding the external IP from a Workstation, i.e. does the Freenet webinterface spill the external IP and if yes, can it be configured, not to?

=== RetroShare ===

Not suited for Whonix for the Default-Download-Version.

In fact [http://retroshare.sourceforge.net RetroShare] is not an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymizer anonymizing network], it is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend friend-to-friend] (F2F) network, or optionally a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(file_sharing) darknet]. RetroShare has a very different audience and threat model. RetroShare does not support using an outproxy yet, for this reason, it can not replace Tor on the Whonix-Gateway.

=== Proxies / Proxy Chains ===

This is a summary of [[Comparison Of Tor Proxies CGI proxies Proxy Chains And VPN Services]].

&quot;(High) Anonymous&quot; Proxies or even &quot;Elite&quot; Proxy Chains are not suited for Whonix for the Default-Download-Version.

* Inferior to Onion Routing (Tor). Just two strong points (many more exist): no encryption between the user and the proxy possible (only end-to-end encryption possible); no onion routing alright (changing circuits).
* Difficult (impossible?) to find a free, stable proxy, which is supposed to be legally used as proxy and which could handle enough Default-Download-Version users.
* In adrelanos opinion: less safe than Tor.

=== Combinations of Anonymity Networks ===

Not suited for Whonix for the Default-Download-Version.

There is too much controversy, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN Tor Plus VPN or Proxy].

Controversy is avoided as a political project strategy with the goal to protect the project:

Quoted from the [FAQ]: ''&quot;Whonix tries to be as less special as possible to ease security auditing of Whonix. Any changes to the Tor routing algorithm should be proposed, discussed and eventually implemented upstream in Tor on torproject.org. And if discussion fails, a Tor fork could be created. Tor has already been forked at least once. Doing such changes directly in Whonix would limit discussions about Whonix to the security of the modified routing algorithm. To allow further exploration of Whonix security, it is required to be as agnostic as possible about all parts of Whonix.&quot;''

The user is able to tunnel Other Anonymizing Networks over Tor (see [[Other Anonymizing Networks]] in case you're interested).

== Tunneling other Other Anonymizing Networks over Tor ==

It's possible with Whonix. (See [[Other Anonymizing Networks]] in case you're interested).

Depending on your threat model (see [[Design]]), [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/ JonDonym] can be potentially used as a replacement for Tor. Prefer the [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/wiki/index.php/JonDoDaemon_for_Debian console version] of 'JonDo – the IP changer', otherwise you would have to install a desktop environment, which needs a lot more RAM, CPU and disc space (not possible on most embedded devices).

Free users can [[https://shop.anonymous-proxy-servers.net/bin/payment?lang#en#vorteile|only only use port 80 (http) and 443 (https)]]. Socks is [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/about.html only available for paying premium users]. Therefore free users can only reach services listening on remote port 80 or 443. Normal browsing will work, other stuff, for example IRC on port 6667 will not work. Paying premium users can use all services.

In comparison to Tor, JonDo does not offer a TransPort or DnsPort. For that reason, transocks_ev ([https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/transocks.html download here]) is needed. Note, that you can not use the firewall rules provided [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/transocks.html under transocks_ev]. You need to adjust the whonix firewall ({{WhonixFirewall}}).

Small update: there is now [[VPN-Firewall]].

'''Development stalled.''' '''''UNTESTED!''''' [Dev] &quot;#SupportforVPNsasTorreplacementOPTIONALFEATURE dev thread&quot;

In this chapter we explain, how you can replace Tor with a VPN. Regarding security see 'Introduction' on this page at the top. It's your responsibility to find a (non-logging, safe) free/paid VPN provider or to stick with Tor.

(1). Test if your host internet connection is working.

(2). Test if your tor internet connection is working.

(3). Store your routing table before starting the VPN and before modifying anything. Type in console:

&lt;pre&gt;route&lt;/pre&gt;

(4). Start VPN.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo openvpn /etc/openvpn/client.conf&lt;/pre&gt;

(5). Test if your ISP IP gets replaced with the VPN IP.

(6). Store the modified routing table. Type in console:

&lt;pre&gt;route&lt;/pre&gt;

(7). Delete your default route and set your new default route to the virtual VPN network adapter.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo route del default
sudo route add default dev tun0&lt;/pre&gt;

(8). Test if your VPN IP is still valid.

(9). Store the modified routing table. Type in console:

&lt;pre&gt;route&lt;/pre&gt;

(10). For testing purposes, kill your OpenVPN connection.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo killall openvpn&lt;/pre&gt;

(11). Test if you can NOT connect to anything anymore. That's the whole point to prevent any leaks in the clear.

TODO:

* Testing.
* Autostart everything.
* Use up in /etc/network/interfaces.
* Final step: forwarding traffic from the Workstation to the Gateway.
* Extra: VPNchains (two or more independent VPN providers in a chain)

== Proxies as a Tor replacement (ProxyBOX) ==

'''Development stalled.''' '''Not finished yet.'''

[Dev] &quot;#SupportforproxiesasTorreplacementOPTIONALFEATURE dev thread&quot;

It is possible to replace Tor with local or remote proxies. Note that anonymity is sufficiently lower with (single hop) proxies. The difficulty is, that most proxies lack a TransPort and DnsPort.

It also depends, what kind of proxy you want to use.

See also [[Tunnel_Proxy_or_SSH_or_VPN_through_Tor#Transparent_Proxying|Transparent Proxying]] (Describes Transparent Proxying inside Whonix-Workstation to an extra proxy, i.e. Whonix-Workstation -&gt; Tor -&gt; Proxy.)

There are two options available. 1. Transparent Proxying Method or 2. The Proxy Settings Method.

=== Depending on Proxy type ===

http proxies are not suited, because we would not be able to connect to https protected websites. The setup for https, socks4(a)/5 proxies should be very similar.

=== Transparent Proxying Method ===

'''Development stalled.''' '''Not finished.'''

Transparent Proxying (like Whonix with Tor's TransPort) is, due to technical limitations, not fully supported by proxies. Proxies do not offer a DnsPort and also do not act as a DNS server. While it's possible to relay TCP and UDP traffic through the proxy on the IP level (using iptables), you would still always require known (you know the IP) DNS server. (i.e. public DNS server such as OpenDNS, Google, httpsdnsd) DNS resolution would look like: Proxy-Workstation -&gt; Proxy-Gateway -&gt; Proxy -&gt; DNS server. It's technically not possible to let the proxy transparently (!) do the DNS resolution (no tools available) - at least not that we know after extended research know of. This is because proxies offer hostname resolution, but not DNS.

Future:
This technical limitation may be lifted if redsocks [https://github.com/darkk/redsocks/issues/23 Feature Request: fake DNS resolver] gets implemented. 

Due to the DNS issue, you can't completely hide behind the proxy (using it transparently). You always would have to reveal, that you are using a public (or private) extra DNS resolver. Of course, you would also not only have to trust the proxy, but also the extra DNS server, which can see, log and correlate all your DNS queries.

For TCP and UDP: Proxy-Workstation -&gt; Proxy-Gateway -&gt; network layer -&gt; redsocks -&gt; proxy For DNS: Proxy-Workstation -&gt; Proxy-Gateway -&gt; network layer -&gt; redsocks -&gt; proxy -&gt; public DNS server

Update:

Maybe https://github.com/jtRIPper/dns-tcp-socks-proxy could help?

=== Proxy Settings Method ===

'''Development stalled.''' '''Not finished.'''

Design: The Proxy-Workstation is on an isolated internal LAN (similar to Whonix's Whonix-Workstation design) and can't connect to the internet directly. (Iptables rules on the Proxy-Gateway forbid that.) All applications installed inside the Proxy-Workstation have to use the correct [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#classicalcommonway:usetheapplicationsproxysettings proxy settings] or a wrapper https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#notsocommon:useawrapper:forcetheapplicationtouseaproxytorsocksusewithtor

For TCP, UDP and DNS: Proxy-Workstation -&gt; Proxy-Gateway -&gt; proxy

= Freenet =

== Freenet on the Whonix-Gateway (FreenetBOX) ==

Can be also potentially only be used parallel to Tor. It's impossible to tunnel Freenet through Tor (see above). Also replacing Tor with Freenet is impossible, as freenet is a separated network, not designed to exit the network. Apt-get couldn't work.

Not written yet.

= Retroshare =

== RetroShare as Anonymizer ==

In fact [http://retroshare.sourceforge.net RetroShare] is not an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymizer anonymizing network], it is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend friend-to-friend] (F2F) network, or optionally a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(file_sharing) darknet]. RetroShare has a very different audience and threat model. RetroShare does not support using an outproxy yet, for this reason, it can not replace Tor on the Whonix-Gateway.

Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation

* Better comment on the top for .d style configuration folders/files as contributed by @JasonJAyalaP
* [[Desktop#RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]]: now easier to use other display managers. It simply starts whatever the default display manager is.
* whonixcheck version check (Whonix News), now supports - checking Whonix Build Version and Whonix Deb Version separately - having multiple up to date versions (for example for stable, testers and developers) - having separate news per build or deb version
* whonixcheck: Deactivated checking status of bootclockrandomization, timesanitycheck and timesync. Its already tested every time, timesync runs. Leaving it enabled in whonixcheck could make some users believe, that whonixcheck runs timesync, which it does not.
* whonixcheck, timesync: To get rid of the confusing line &quot;/usr/lib/whonix/whonixcheck/help_output: line 348:  9404 Killed [...]&quot; at the end, added disown &quot;$ZENITY_PROGRESS_PID&quot;.
* whonixcheck: prefixed all messages with the name of each test.
* whonixcheck: New WHONIXCHECK_DISABLE_TRANS_PORT_TEST configuration variable. When set to 1, skips whonixchecks test for Tor's TransPort. Useful in case you deactivated Tor's TransPort.; Separate help messages for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation in case network connection (whonixcheck's SocksPort test) failed.; Better help messages for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation in case network connection (whonixcheck's SocksPort test) failed.; New additional help text in case Tor is not detected &quot;You could try to find out if this IP is/was a Tor exit relay using a search engine or ExoneraTor: https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html&quot;. Lets see if we keep that in the final.; Different help messages if Tor detection on Tor's SocksPort failed vs Tor detection on Tor's TransPort failed.
* improved many messages in whonixcheck, timesync, whonixsetup
* no longer hardcoding MAC addresses, no longer sharing MAC addresses among all Whonix versions, was very little gain, while it can confuse complex setups
* whonixcheck: - added option to skip SocksPort test for [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/57 #57] - no longer delete temporary folder, gets automatically deleted only makes debugging/auditing harder
* converting Whonix News Blogs to plain text, so no external links to wordpress.com get loaded
* added pandoc (required for whonixcheck as html2text converter)
* whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list.whonix: changed from Debian stable (wheezy) to Debian testing (jessi) for [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/60 #60] (installation of python-stem)
* whonixcheck: now also checks Tor's bootstrap status using Tor's control port using [[Dev/Control Port Filter Proxy|Control Port Filter Proxy]]
* added hint to read [[Pre Install Advice]] to VirtualBox license files ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/64 #64])
* quick and dirty hack to make AppArmor play well with tor, obfsproxy and flashproxy for [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/67 #67]
* added log viewer ksystemlog to whonix-shared-desktop-kde
* moved whonixcheck zenity progress bar and result message to the top left, so it does not overlap with sdwdate's progress bar or result message
* replaced tails_htp with sdwdate
* AppArmor: added global /etc/hosts.whonix r, /etc/resolv.conf.whonix r, On Whonix-Workstation this file does not contain anything interesting (except some special configuration) and Whonix-Gateway isn't supposed to have applications reading those files. Closes [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/66 #66]
* added apparmor-notify to whonix-shared-packages-recommended: Notification with passive popups when AppArmor restricts something. There are no profiles activated by default (except Tor, which gets loaded by its default init script), but still useful to prevent confusion just in case.
* No longer abort whonixcheck if Tor's SocksPort isn't reachable ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/49 #49]). Now directly checking Tor's bootstrap status through Tor's control port ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/57 #57]).
* whonix_shared/usr/bin/uwt: Ignoring -t server_type and therefore defaulting to 4. 5 does not work well with the torsocks version from Debian testing. (Things like dget and update-command-not-found are broken.) Reporting a bug against torsocks is not worth it, since torsocks is currently being rewritten anyway.

Whonix-Gateway

* whonixsetup: Working around another bug in Tor. When starting Tor fails, it does not return a non-zero return code.
* added apper to whonix-gateway-packages-recommend
* Added RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter info message to Whonix-Gateway wallpaper.
* Whonix-Gateway firewall: added settings for an optional Tor relay
* whonix_gateway/usr/bin/whonix_firewall: Fix. When GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_FLASHPROXY is set to 1, iptables does not support -p all --dport. See http://serverfault.com/questions/279361/iptables-p-all-dport. Changed to -p tcp, which is sufficient, according to https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto

Whonix-Workstation

* added pinentry-qt4 to whonix-workstation-default-applications, required to make KGpg symmetric encryption (and gnupg-agent) work out of the box
* No longer add Tor Browser default icon to the Desktop (already existing icons won't be touched, so this will appear in the next build version), the Tor Browser Recommend icon is still on the desktop and the default one can still be created from the start menu, closes [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/58 #58]
* Whonix's torbrowser update check and download script: has now a working progress bar.
* Whonix's torbrowser update check and download script: fixed zenity cancel button, cancel now effectively terminates still running curl instances and can therefore prevent endless data attacks or bugs.

Source Code

* new bash pseudo GUI toolkit /usr/lib/whonix/doutput
* whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_create_swap_file: fixed support for re-running
* radically shortened readme
* added libfile-fcntllock-perl to build dependencies: - required to silence dpkg-gencontrol:   warning: File::FcntlLock not available; using floc
* renamed whonix_workstation/etc/whonix.d/30_torbrowser to whonix_workstation/etc/whonix.d/30_torbrowser_default
* new maintainer script: release/resign_repository, Refreshes repository. OpenPGP Resignes and updates valid-until field.
* Got rid of time consuming &quot;chown --recursive user:user /home/user/&quot; while updating by running the required commands as user in the first place
* debian/rules-helper.bsh: added --no-start to dh_installinit. Restarting the init scripts while updating isn't required. All init scripts are su
* postinst.d scripts: better error message in case a postinst.d script ever fails
* postinst.d scripts: hide &quot;set -x&quot; debug output, unless WHONIX_DEB_DEBUG=1
* added whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/pre.bsh, a script supposed to be sourced by all postinst.d scripts
* uwtwrapper: renamed variable ip to uwtwrapper_gateway_ip to avoid conflicts
* Fix: Skipping to source config.d files such as .dpkg-old and .dpkg-dist.
* Whonix News v2: changed location to https://sourceforge.net/projects/whonixdevelopermetafiles/
* whonix_shared/usr/bin/whonix_repository: moved repository to https://sourceforge.net/projects/whonixdevelopermetafiles/
* whonix_shared/usr/lib/whonix/whonixcheck/50_check-whonix-news: added --fail to curl, so it returns non-zero when sourceforge replies 404 (in case the file has been forgotten to upload). Otherwise we would end up with the error html page and throw a OpenPGP verification failure message.
* added debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages, a script to manually update from source code, closed [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/52 #52]
* apply our apt preferences.d settings (apt pinning) while building Whonix from source code and while updating Whonix from source code
* Added python-stem to whonix-shared-packages-dependencies.
* explicitly define /etc/apt/sources.list for grml-debootstrap to ensure grml-debootstrap won't fetch non-free software
* `displace`ed /etc/apparmor.d/local/system_tor
* added dh-apparmor to build dependencies
* Revised the way how the temporary local apt repository is created and removed.
* Fixed a bug when an own signing key was used to sign the local apt repository. No longer copying the whole pubring.gpg to /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/, only copying the specific signing key.
* Fixed a failure bug when WHONIX_BUILD_APT_CODENAME was not set to local (now also works for stable, testers and developers).
* Reduced code duplication.

= 101adretemp (uploaded to Whonix developers apt repository) =

Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation

* whonixcheck, timesync: cleaner locking mechanism, no longer using pgrep, thus fixing a confusing message while booting
* whonixsetup: starting whonixcheck after enabling Tor ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/56 #56])


Whonix-Gateway

* improved whonixsetup output
* added icons for Whonix-Gateway desktop

Whonix-Workstation

* whonix_workstation/usr/bin/torbrowser: updated links to important and feature blog
* Deactivating kmix autostart. Workaround to fix Klipper (and others?) autostart. Working around bug http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi
* torbrowser: added --clearnet option. Uses torproject.org clearnet domain instead of torprojects Tor hidden service (hs). Useful in case the hs 
* Tor Browser Update and Start script: Will no longer show a browser error when whonixcheck (rawdog) hasn't fetched Whonix News blog already. Wil
* Whonix torbrowser Start and Update script now reads /etc/whonix.d/30_torbrowser_default which can contain the language setting
* torbrowser: updated forum link to [[Special:AWCforum]]


Source Code

* whonix_gateway/usr/lib/whonix/cpf-tcpserver: better escaping (now produces no more strange output when telneting it or accessing it with tor-ct
* FIX: added QUIT to control port filter proxy white list, otherwise after 40 connections tcpserver wouldn't accept any more connections
* whonix_gateway/usr/lib/whonix/cpf-tcpserver: exit and therefore terminate connection when getting QUIT 
* Whonix-Gateway: added uuid-runtime, contains uuidgen, required for Control Port Filter Proxy
* new release/maketorrent, maintainer script for creation of torrent downloads for Whonix
* updated links from sourceforge.net to whonix.org
* build-steps.d/2600_export-vbox-vm: add version number to final .ova file
* new chroot post script: Storing from which Whonix version a build was created in /usr/share/whonix/build_version.
* /etc/fstab: Fix. Removed &quot;UUID=26ada0c0-1165-4098-884d-aafd2220c2c6 /               ext4    noatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1&quot; since we are no longer modifying the uuid of the virtual hdd

= 97adretemp (uploaded as testers-only VM build version, uploaded to Whonix stable apt repository) =

Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation

* only disable powersaving if a virtual machine can be detected
* new whonixdesktop_autostart_decision_feature variable, for easy deactivation of that feature
* VirtualBox import license text: added license text with some help, disclaimer and license
* removed hardware modifications, very little gain, while it breaks enabling uefi and confuses other things as well
* added aptitude stream isolation wrapper
* whonixcheck, timesync --showcli: added &quot;End of &quot;$SCRIPTNAME&quot;. Feel free to press &lt;enter&gt; to return back to your normal prompt.&quot;
* moved blog to wordpress.com, better than sourceforge, because wordpress.com supports SSL, closed [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/23 #23]

Whonix-Workstation

* deactivate the kgpg tray icon by default ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/10 #10]), not perfect, but less confusing, since it will now hopefully start in foreground

Source Code

* timesanitycheck: fixed, since version file does not exist anymore, using newly created build_timestamp by whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_build_timestamp
* whonix_gateway/usr/lib/whonix/whonixsetup/ft_m_1: working around a bug in Tor
* fixed modification of whonix modified /home/user/.bashrc
* updated shortcuts
* whonix_shared/usr/bin/backgroundd: revised
* added gsfonts, required for backgroundd (desktop background image manipulation)
* whonix_gateway/usr/bin/controlportfilt: add &quot;-l host&quot; to disable local hostname lookup to prevent timeouts (since there is on purpose no functional /etc/resolv.conf on Whonix-Gateway)
* whonix_gateway/usr/bin/controlportfilt: more debugging
* fixed firewall rules for control port filter proxy; comments; refactoring
* gateway controlportfilt: added -H to tcpserver, so it doesn't hang if /etc/resolv.conf is not configured, which is the case on Whonix-Gateway
* gateway controlportfilt: added debugging to tcpserver
* gateway controlportfilt: fix, let tcpserver listen on all interfaces, not just 127.0.0.1, so Whonix-Workstation can reach it. It's filtered from outside due to whonix_firewall.
* added ucspi-tcp, contains tcpserver, required for Control Port Filter Proxy
* renamed whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/keys/tpoarchive-keys.d/readme to whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/keys/tpoarchive-keys.d/.readme so apt-key ignores it and doesn't throw an error
* renamed build-steps folder to build-steps.d
* added virt-what
* reorganized updating tpo package list, installing deb.torproject.org-keyring also on Whonix-Workstation, installing torsocks and tor in case the version in tpo repository is newer
* whonixcheck, timesync: fix, don't delete temporary folder too early
* whonixsetup: made it more robust, fix, enabled debugging
* whonix_workstation/usr/bin/torbrowser: fix mkdir when run from non-home folder
* Whonix-Gateway: only update debian (/etc/apt/sources.list) and torproject.org (/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list) package lists for eventually installing newer Tor, torsocks, obfsproxy from torproject.org. (Only in case it's newer in torproject.org repository.)
* no longer store backups of grub.cfg in /boot/grub/, store it in /var/lib/whonix/grub-backup instead, so it can not confuse grub, if they change something some day
* added git to build dependencies
* new whonix_build_both script: small hack to build both virtual machines, as long as whonix_build does not support --all.
* not re-creating the packages, if nothing changed
* get version number from latest git tag while building from source code
* automatically add to debian changelog from which git head it was build
* new way to find out locally using Whonix version (now using dpkg-query); automatically bumping upstream version of Whonix, no longer bumping deb revision; deleted whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/version (no longer required)
* build-steps/1200_create-debian-packages: Only purge local repository before adding new packages, do not purge remote (production) repository.
* .gitignore: added debian/patches; added .pc
* build-steps/1200_create-debian-packages: allow without root and without --torgateway or --torworkstation switch
* Makefile: create lintian.log not in source folder but in its parent folder
* using git archive instead of tar for tarball creation
* new internal (repository) folder readme; new signature folder readme; new main folder readme; and upload scripts
* output

(adretemp82)

Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation

* whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list.whonix:
** out commented sources (deb-src)
** only using: &quot;deb http://security.debian.org stable/updates main contrib non-free&quot; and
** deb &quot;http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free&quot;
** added comment: &quot;#deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ stable-updates main contrib non-free&quot;
** technical comments
* If bare BARE_METAL is set to 1 (when using whonix_build with --bare-metal), skip scripts, which are not required for creating Whonix with physical isolation, so physical isolation users can also use the whonix_build script.
* added tor-ctrl
* new man page: tor-ctrl
* whonixcheck, timsync: inform at cli, if we are still waiting for whonixcheck and/or timesync's results

Whonix-Gateway

* Control Port Filter Proxy: [[Dev/Control Port Filter Proxy]]
* new man page: controlportfilt
* added tor-ctrl
* added firewall rules for Control Port Filter Proxy
* Control Port Filter Proxy: Lie when we are asked &quot;GETINFO net/listeners/socks&quot;.

Source Code

* removed dependency for bc, no longer required for whonixcheck/timesync (using expr instead)
* added imagemagick, because it's required for /usr/bin/backgroundd
* whonix_workstation/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_gpgconf: added sanity test &quot;sudo -u user gpg --gpgconf-test&quot;
* build source code: better way to parse command line options
* deleted obsolete file whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_grub (now solved in chroot.d post script)
* deleted obsolete and neglected TODO file, see https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues for TODO
* installing from separate local apt repository when building from source code
* build-steps/1100_prepare-build-machine and development/Whonix-Shared_packages: added haveged to build depends
* build-steps/1200_create-debian-packages: create local signing key for local APT repository, yes a signing key is also required for local installation from local package repository, see script comments
* help-steps/pre: added some colorful output
* added colored outputs to the build scripts debian/control: set priority of whonix-x-(packages|files|postinst) and (dummy)tor to important and made the other ones optional. This has the advantage, that if the user tries to remove an essential package, apt-get will loudly complain, while less important packages can be removed.
* debug-steps/interactive-chroot-img: mounting local APT repository, if already available (will fail open, if not)
* new variable WHONIX_BUILD_APT_CODENAME
* added buildconfig.d configuration folder
* Extracted code for packaging Whonix in debian/rules and made a rules-helper.bsh script, which I can maintain better.
* dummytor: renamed package tor to dummytor and use Provides: tor. This prevents Whonix-Gateway from fetching dummytor.
* renamed whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-post.d/70_sources to whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-post.d/75_sources, so it runs after all apt-get install actions
* renamed skip_scripts variable to WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS
* added WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS support to build-steps
* converted native debian package into non-native debian package; new help-steps/make-tarball for creating debian orig tarball
* added debian/watch
* whonix_gateway/usr/lib/whonix/whonixsetup/ft_m_1: no longer try to reload a Tor which is eventually not started
* renamed VERSION variable to WHONIX_BUILD_WHONIX_VERSION
* whonix_shared/usr/bin/whonix_repository: - support adding multiple keys in /usr/share/whonix/keys/whonix-keys.d/* - more simple and robust code for revoke_keys - tested everything
* now using debuild - now also signing packages - (local repository was already signed)
* moved local apt repository to whonix_binary folder so it's no longer in the source folder and won't get included in the source tarball
* added debug-steps/reprepro-wrapper
* new variable WHONIX_BUILD_UPGRADE_BUILD_MACHINE to turn off apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade and setting dpkg --force-confold during build step &quot;prepare build machine&quot;
* clean up /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90whonix-build-confold at the end
* deleted whonix_shared/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20whonix-oldconfig, no longer required since we now have proper packaging
* debian/rules: also parse /etc/init.d folders for gateway and workstation
* add Whonix apt repository to /etc/sources.list.d/whonix.list using the whonix_repository tool renamed variable DISTRUST_WHONIX_APT_REPO to WHONIX_APT_REPOSITORY_DISTRUST_ENV renamed variable WHONIX_APT_REPOSITORY_DISTRUST to WHONIX_APT_REPOSITORY_DISTRUST_CONFIG
* if the builder provides its own signing key in buildconfig.d WHONIX_LOCAL_SIGNING_KEY_FOLDER variable, use that key, otherwise use an automatically created signing key
* added repository upload script

(adretemp68)

Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation

* much work on an auto updater and packaging Whonix for Debian
* added KDE Lowfat Settings
* improved many script output messages
* whonixcheck: code simplification; more robust progress_bar in corner cases.
* htpdate: 180 seconds for curl timeout as per https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-February/002635.html
* &lt;s&gt;An anonymous user suggested, that MAC addresses used by Whonix starting with vendor prefix 080027 are too uncommon.; Used https://github.com/EtiennePerot/macchiato/tree/master/oui/wireless_laptop.sh (Integrated wireless interfaces in laptop computers) to find more popular MAC vendor ids.; Changed MAC addresses:&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;Whonix-Gateway eth0 '00:26:82:47:5c:e1' (Gemtek Technology Co., Ltd. - HP Laptop)&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;Whonix-Gateway eth1 '00:13:02:9c:f1:91' (Intel Corporate - Fujitsu Amilo Pi 1556 Notebook, Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Adapter)&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;Whonix-Workstation eth0 '00:21:00:4d:8f:08' (GemTek Technology Co., Ltd. - HP Pavilion TX2510EA)&lt;/s&gt;
* Added Time Sanity Check init script.
* /etc/apt/preferences.d/50_banned-packages
* Let htpdate wait for bootclockrandomization.
* whonixcheck and timesync: Warn if bootclockrandomization and/or timesanitycheck failed.
* Time Sanity Check before and after htpdate
* configuration folder /etc/whonix.d for .d-style configuration files
* added khelpcenter4 package
* added faketime package
* added timeprivacy script
* new man pages:
** uwt
** timesync
** time_privacy
** scurl
* /etc/kde4/kdm/kdmrc: Working around a rare bug, where kdm did not start because of a timeout by using higher timeout. http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=45648
* new generic uwt/timeprivacy wrapper
* deleted old uwt wrappers
* using new generic uwt master wrapper /usr/bin/uwtwrapper instead of many copies of the same script
* fixed the bug where the uwt wrappers gave wrong arguments to curl and therefore broke applications dependent on curl, such as apt-file, update-flashplugin
* added libgl1-mesa-dri to prevent error (EE) AIGLX error: dlopen of /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dri/swrast_dri.so failed (/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dri/swrast_dri.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory) in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
* Removed xdg-utils, since we do not need them to create desktop icons and start menu entries.
* Check total RAM. If more than 512 MB -&gt; start KDE. If less (like 128 MB) -&gt; do not start KDE. This should be quite convenient, because users with low RAM could reduce (Whonix-Gateway) RAM to 128 MB and even if they sometimes wanted to configure/check something, they could assign 512 RAM and automagically boot into the graphical KDE desktop. There are also many settings in /etc/whonix.d/ to configure this feature, so if you want you can also add much RAM and still don't boot a desktop environment, use different display managers and so on.
* whonixcheck: now reading /etc/whonix.d/ configuration folder
* whonixcheck: added option WHONIXCHECK_NO_EXIT_ON_TRANS_PORT_DETECTION_FAILURE
* whonixcheck, timesync: bugfix: will now kill the process, if the cancel button in zenity is pressed
* added apparmor-profiles (but didn't enable enforce mode or added any useful profiles)
* added apparmor-utils (but didn't enable enforce mode or added any useful profiles)
* added /etc/default/grub
* higher console resolution 1024x768 (without X)
* enable &quot;apparmor=1 security=apparmor&quot; by default (but didn't enable enforce mode or added any useful profiles)
* more verbose output while booting, since on slow machines it may look like there is no progress otherwise
* reduced timeout from 300 to 180 to be on par with Tails
* added /usr/bin/whonix_repository which can be used to easily disable Whonix's APT repository

Whonix-Gateway

* first time connection wizard
* graphical Whonix-Gateway (got a KDE desktop now), wallpaper with most important information
* /etc/whonix_firewall.d/ for .d-style configuration files
* added option for Flash Proxy to firewall config in /etc/whonix_firewall.d/
* /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list: Activated torproject.org Debian Wheezy repository, so obfs3 can be downloaded.
* added support for obfs3 out of the box
* new man pages:
** leaktest
** armwrapper
** whonix
** whonixsetup
* /usr/local/bin/whonix_firewall: comment for using Custom Open Ports on external interface
* added SocksPorts separate for KDE and GNOME wide applications
* /usr/bin/whonix_firewall: Port 9150 is no longer a custom port. It is now SOCKS_PORT_TBB_DEFAULT, supposed to be used by stock TBB running unmodified inside Whonix-Workstation.
* /etc/tor/torrc: added 127.0.0.1:9150 for consistency
* increased Whonix-Gateway RAM from 128 MB to 768 MB, because Whonix-Gateway becomes graphical
* arm wrapper to start arm without a password now passing command line arguments to arm
* arm wrapper also announces its existence when run because &quot;set -x&quot; is now set to avoid confusion
* Removed custom socks port 9151, because this is TBB's default Tor Control Port. Therefore we shouldn't train users to use it as custom socks port to avoid confusion.

Whonix-Workstation

* Added Boot Clock Randomization. This is useful before timesync succeeded, naturally timesync runs before timesync succeded, to make sure that the host clock and Whonix-Workstation clock differ.; Open for arguments if that should be added to Whonix-Gateway as well. See TimeSync design.
* added kmix
* added graphical alternatives manager, galternatives
* torbrowser: Deactivate tor-launcher, a Vidalia replacement as browser extension, to prevent running Tor over Tor. https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6009 https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-launcher.git TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1
* XChat: No longer moving XChat plugins into a new folder. Using dpkg-divert instead to deactivate them. User documentation explains how to re-enable them.
* new man pages:
** xchat-reset
** torbrowser
** leaktest
** whonix
** whonix_firewall
* added proxy settings for KDE wide application
* torbrowser new --lang &quot;language&quot; command line option, see man torbrowser
* torbrowser: new option for advanced users --nokilltb

Source Code

* whonix_gateway/usr/local/bin/leaktest: using true instead of echo, since we set -x anyway
* whonix_gateway/usr/local/bin/leaktest: added comment in/out for &quot;FascistFirewall 1&quot;.
* improved error handling
* code refactoring
* help-steps/pre: fewer useless debug output
* Gateway and Workstation: /etc/X0.hosts Add xhost exception, as required for zenity, since cron starts as root and whonixcheck (zenity) starts as user.
* better documented package lists
* shared: added debsums to package selection. Added a sanity check using debsums to the chroot-script 30_internal-checks.
* chroot-scripts-pre.d
* chroot-scripts-post.d
* postinst.d
* added skip_scripts variable
* No longer setting KDEDIRS in whonix_workstation/etc/environment. Using whonix_shared/etc/X11/Xsession.d/50whonix instead.
* WHONIX_TARGET_ARCH can now be set in build configuration
* Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation: Deleted /etc/sudoers.d/whonix and created multiple small files instead.
* new file release/list_source_files
* new build-step 32_verify_copied_files: checks if everything from the whonix_gateway/whonix_workstation and whonix_shared actually was correctly copied using diff.
* Added Tor Project Archive (0x886DDD89) key, which signs the deb.torproject.org repositories and archives as chroot script. It later gets updated by torproject keyring package.
* no longer required to mess with /etc/rc.local and /etc/environment so the user can easly edit without any conflicts with Whonix configuration files (moved to /etc/profile.d/ instead)
* Whonix-Gateway, new chroot script, whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-post.d/70_tor: downloading tor related software from Torprojects repository in case it contains newer software. At time of writing obfsproxy in Torprojects repository already contained obfs3 while Debian repository had only obfs2.
* whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list: changed from wheezy to stable, because wheezy became stable.
* gateway and workstation, package selection: Removed virtuoso-minimal, which was installed as workaround in 0787deb78d24678d87ef704ed206dd0b6b4d7e3e as dependency for nepomuk (nepomuk comes with kde-workspace). Since nepomuk now gets disabled, virtuoso is no longer required.
* deleted defunct chroot-script whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/40_variables, it never worked, variables set by it were ignored by following chroot-scripts. Those variables get set in /home/user/Whonix/help-steps/variables.
* Disable uwt while building Whonix, because it is not functional while building Whonix from source code. Instead of doing this in every build and chroot script, do it in a central place, the help-steps/variables script.
* mass rename whonix_(gateway|workstation|shared)/usr/local/... to whonix_(gateway|workstation|shared)/usr/... ; mass rename /usr/local/... to /usr/...
* Removed line for changing partition uuid from build-steps/35_run-chroot-scripts-img, because it didn't really belong there and made it its own step build-steps/34_change_partition_uuid.
* We no longer place uwt wrappers into /usr/local/bin/&lt;uwt-wrapped-application&gt;. Therefore we now use dpkg-divert /usr/bin/&lt;uwt-wrapped-application&gt; to /usr/bin/&lt;uwt-wrapped-application&gt; and symlink /usr/bin/&lt;uwt-wrapped-application&gt; to /usr/bin/uwtwrapper.
* whonix_shared/usr/bin/scurl: better way to forward extra arguments, using &lt;math&gt;{1+&quot;&lt;/math&gt;@&quot;} instead of $*
* whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d/70_banned_packages: Removed code 'echo &quot;package-name hold&quot; | dpkg --set-selections', because it's no longer necessary, we're now using /etc/apt/preferences.d/ instead.
* build-steps/10_prepare-build-machine: added ruby-ronn to build dependencies (required for creating man pages)
* whonixcheck, timesync: better handling of short and long options; -help -&gt; --help -autostart -&gt; --autostart -cron -&gt; --cron
* whonixcheck: now using whonix-keys.d folder
* whonixcheck, timesync: output and startup functions are now the same on Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation, since Whonix-Gateway is now graphical as well
* DummyTor now gets created along with the other packages in debian/control
* added two new help-steps prevent-daemons-from-starting and unprevent-daemons-from-starting, because the (un)chroot are ignored for bare-metal and preventing daemons from starting is still recommended for bare-metal.
* whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/apt.conf: changed ip from 192.168.0.11 to 127.0.0.1 to make it independent from host network configuration
* got rid of whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/apt.conf, using apt-get command line rather
* build-steps: using http_proxy variable for setting up apt-cacher-ng as proxy for grml-debootstrap
* build-steps/2600_export-vbox-vm: added --manifest (hashes which can be used to determine if the appliance components arrived intact)
* build-steps/2600_export-vbox-vm: also added --manifest, --product, --vendor, --vendorurl, --version (Not yet using: --producturl)
* Using config-package-dev to solve conflicts when Whonix deb packages overwrite files owned by other packages.
* build-steps/2000_install-common-packages: prevent mounting /etc/resolv.conf from the host inside the chroot, /etc/resolv.conf from whonix source folder can get installed.;
* deleted whonix_workstation/etc/polipo/config (not installed, not in use)
* build-steps/1100_prepare-build-machine: - no longer installing dependencies for creating virtual machines for bare metal builds - no longer installing dependencies for bare metal builds for virtual machine builds - removed debootstrap as build dependency, because grml-debootstrap Depends on it and therefore automatically fetches it - removed git as build dependency, git is only required to download the source code but anyone who has the source code, doesn't need git (if not planing to contribute) - replaced qemu with qemu-utils, because that includes the required tools - code refactoring -
* build-steps/1300_create-debian-img: removed unneeded --keep_src_list option from grml-debootstrap#
* build-steps/2500_create-vbox-vm: removed hardware modifications, very little gain, while it breaks enabling uefi
* run update-grub while building Whonix and fix /boot/grub/grub.cfg due to a known bug in grub
* new WHONIX_DEB_DEBUG variable
* install from local APT repository, no longer required to copy packages manually into the image
* update-rc.d $display_manager remove as dpkg post invoke hook, otherwise as soon as a display manager (kdm by default) get upgraded, its postinst script will revert Whonix's post chroot script and Whonix's feature, which deactivated the /etc/init.d/ autostart mechanism, what would break Whonix's feature to decide to start a display manager depending on free RAM and other configurable settings
* build-steps/1100_prepare-build-machine: speed up apt-get update
* help-steps/variables: removed deprecated SNAPSHOT_DESCRIPTION variable
* adding Whonix APT repository signing key with apt-key while building Whonix

(adretemp40)

Whonix-Workstation

* longer installing polipo by default. It's not required for anything.
* torbrowser: Added a meaningful error message, if the Tor Browser folder does not exist and recommend to run the updater in that case.

Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation

* Added /etc/hostname with content &quot;host&quot;. Even though grml-debootstrap already creates /etc/hostname with content &quot;host build-steps/35_run-chroot-scripts-img: added support for bare metal users.

Source Code

* torbrowser: merged tb_start function into tb_start_new_tab.

(0.6.1)

Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation

* timesync: added autostart status notification
* Added /etc/apt.conf.d/20oldconfig: never ask if a configuration file should get updated by dpkg. Always keep the locally installed one.
* Running whonixcheck after a random amount of time (minimum 60 seconds + a random number between 0 and 500) to make the network fingerprint less predictable.

Whonix-Gateway

* torrc, firewall: added port 9050

Whonix-Workstation

* workstation: Disable Apper's mechanism to automatically check for updates, to work around upstream bugs: - https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62575 and https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62576
* timesync: When timesync is run by cron.hourly (/usr/local/bin/htpdate_hourly), and there is nothing important to tell, say nothing. Otherwise there would be such a popup every hour.
* timesync: When timesync is automatically started and nothing important has to be reported, use kdialog --passivepopup, because that is non-intrusive and will automatically fade out. When timesync is manually started, always use zenity.
* timesync: No need for flashing a progress meter, if htpdate already succeeded.
* whonix_workstation/home/user/.bashrc: Do not &quot;cat /etc/motd&quot; on Whonix-Workstation login shell, only in virtual console. (Konsole)
* Workstation: Graphical notify-send notification that start of whonixcheck gets delayed.
* Workstation package selection: added libnotify-bin for whonixcheck.
* whonixcheck: Removed transitional popup, that whonixcheck is no longer autostarted at every boot of Whonix-Workstation.
* torbrowser: Downloading Tor Browser and signature from http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/dist/torbrowser/linux instead from https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser for better security when run inside Whonix.
* torbrowser: Added --max-time 300 to signature download to defeat a endless data or slow retrieval attack.
* torbrowser: downloading signature file before Tor Browser itself. - Would be a pity to download Tor Browser (takes long) only to recognize, that the signature download (takes very little time) fails.
* whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/kde/share/applications/whonix-whonixcheck.desktop: improved icon description.
* torbrowser: Removed tb_create_user_js, since no longer required to change Tor Browser's proxy settings. (Now using rinetd.)
* torbrowser: Always starting Tor Browser with cd ~/tor-browser_&quot;&lt;math&gt;TB_LANG&quot;/ ~/tor-browser_&quot;&lt;/math&gt;TB_LANG&quot;/App/Firefox/firefox --profile Data/profile instead of cd ~/tor-browser_&quot;&lt;math&gt;TB_LANG&quot;/ ~/tor-browser_&quot;&lt;/math&gt;TB_LANG&quot;/start-tor-browser and therefore not starting Vidalia/Tor when the user manually downloaded or updated TBB.
* Workstation: Added rinetd. It prevents Tor over Tor by just installing Tor or by using the complete Tor Browser Bundle, which starts Vidalia and Tor.; This is because, it listens on port 9050 and 9150 and therefore lets a default Tor or TBB fail to start.; Fowards port 127.0.0.1:9050 (Workstation) to 192.168.0.10:9050 (Gateway). Fowards port 127.0.0.1:9150 (Workstation) to 192.168.0.10:9150 (Gateway).

Source Code

* whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/50_adduser-user: Not re-creating user &quot;user&quot;, and therefore perhaps changing an existing password. That should support re-running the script and bare metal better.
* gateway firewall: renamed variable, GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMMING_SSH -&gt; GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_SSH; typo fixes
* renamed: whonix_shared/etc/profile.d/whonixcheck.sh -&gt; whonix_shared/etc/profile.d/20_whonixcheck.sh
* whonix_shared/usr/local/bin/delay: added small help file. It's required to prevent getting the logins sparred.
* whonix_shared/usr/local/bin/whonixcheck-scripts/15_kill-old-instances fixed
* whonixcheck: load help_output module earlier so it also works for the check_autostart module whonix_shared/usr/local/bin/whonixcheck-scripts/25_autostart: disable debugging
* build-steps/30_copy-into-img: Remove symlink /etc/localtime before copying to prevent &quot;cp: &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC' and&lt;/code&gt;/etc/localtime' are the same file&quot; error.
* whonixcheck: better way to autostart
* timesync: added option for -autostart
* chown --recursive user:user -&gt; chown --recursive &quot;&lt;math&gt;USERNAME&quot;:&quot;&lt;/math&gt;USERNAME&quot;
* build-steps/15_prepare-build-machine: using &quot;$USERNAME&quot; instead of user
* chown --recursive user:user -&gt; chown --recursive &quot;&lt;math&gt;USERNAME&quot;:&quot;&lt;/math&gt;USERNAME&quot;
* more consistency: /home/&quot;&lt;math&gt;USERNAME&quot; -&gt; &quot;&lt;/math&gt;HOMEVAR&quot;
* build-steps/15_prepare-build-machine: added creation of user &quot;user&quot;.
* build-steps/20_create-debian-img: arch as variable $ARCH; comments for alternative architectures for custom builds
* help-steps/variables: added &quot;export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive &quot;
* Added new build step 15_prepare-build-machine to ease building from source.
* whonixcheck: removed redundant variable COUNTER
* torbrowser: using general trap; reduced code duplication by sourcing the tbbversion function
* whonixcheck: split the script, which had grown too big over time into many smaller scripts
* timesync: using whonixcheck error handler, reduced code duplication
* timesync: split timesync script into many smaller scripts and reduced code duplication comments
* help-steps/variables: Variable WHONIX_SOURCE_FOLDER supports now being used by different user than &quot;user&quot;.
* whonix_build: Removed &quot;chmod +x &quot;$WHONIX_SOURCE_FOLDER&quot;/build-steps/20_create-debian-img&quot; - no longer required, no longer using the executable bit to decide which steps to run. This is now done using command line switches and variables.
* Fix: build script when not using as user &quot;user&quot; - deactivate trap before running the id command.
* release/whonix_release: Added --armor to gpg --detach-sign. .asc files look better (look like plain text) than .sig (look like binary).
* release/whonix_news: No longer required to update the version manually.; It's now read from whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/version.;
* release/upload_whonix_news: added automatic signing and verification to upload script.; deleted release/whonix_news.asc, since no longer required.
* upload_download_readme: Added automatic sign, verify to upload script.; release/README.asc deleted, since no longer required. release/whonix_release: comments
* release/upload_download_readme: Read version from /whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/version. No longer required to manually edit version.
* whonixcheck: more modular, own function for get_local_whonix_version.
* whonixcheck: No longer hardcoding architecture variable ARCH. Now using uname.
* torbrowser: made the script more modular
* Not trying to creating any users (and thus changing their passwords), if these user accounts already exist. This should support (physical isolation) users better, who changed these passwords already. gateway torrc: using bridge for obfs bridge comment instead of Bridge - both work (tested), but since regular bridges are also already written in lowercase, it's more consistant. (bridges.torproject.org also uses &quot;bridges&quot; in lowercase.)

(0.6.0)

Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation

* Run update-command-not-found while building to prevent prompting the user &quot;Please run update-command-not-found.&quot;.
* Prevent from installing: popularity-contest (privacy); geoclue (privacy); resolvconf (can mess up /etc/resolv.conf); ufw (can mess up firewall); and also for custom builds: canonical-census, unity-lens-shopping, unity-scope-video-remote, unity-scope-musicstores, geoclue-ubuntu-geoip; using dpkg hold; users who wish can overwrite those default banned packages which shouldn't be necessary for anyone but experts

Whonix-Gateway

* torrc: Added comment for mumble server hidden service.

Whonix-Workstation

* Disable xchat plugins no longer with xchat-reset, only disable while building so the user is free to re-enable them.
* Removed redundant hiddenserver-install. No longer required. Whonix documentation explains how to install it a hidden server.

Source Code

* Now easier to understand. More modular. New step based layout.
* Got rid of unclear whonix_internal_install_script. Chroot-Scripts are now in whonix_.../usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/.
* whonix_build -all -tg -tw -fast -tg-fast -fw-fast -clean -clean-tg -clean-tw
* Running whonix_build_clean &quot;&lt;math&gt;MACHINE&quot; before whonix_build_clean &quot;&lt;/math&gt;MACHINE&quot;, i.e. when running whonix_build -all/tg(-fast)/tw(-fast) won't break anymore if running whonix_build -clean(-tg/-tw) has been forgotten beforehand.
* Moved workstation specific icons to workstation folder.; Moved icons to /usr/local/share/whonix/icons/.; Moved gpg public keys to /usr/local/share/whonix/gpg-pubkeys/.
* chmod -x whonix_workstation/home/user/.bashrc
* Removed whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_audio, redundant on Debian/KDE, audio will work out of the box.
* torbrowser: No longer adding additional extensions.torbutton.banned_ports, it was always redundant.
* added /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99timeout to handle apt-get timeouts better
* workstation: added failsafe mechanism to Whonix second, optional, extra firewall
* workstation: Creating the dummytor package while building Whonix.
* Gateway: No longer required to set +i on /etc/resolv.conf. Removed. DHCP is configured to prevent overwriting it and resolvconf is a banned package.
* gateway: added /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/nodnsupdate to prevent showing an error message while booting

= Whonix 0.5.6 Changelog =

Whonix-Gateway

* Fixed a time zone bug, which prevented Tor to connect in some cases.

= Whonix 0.5.5 Changelog =

Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation

* Fixed htpdate_hourly.
* whonixcheck: improved messages.
* whonixcheck: better method for Tor Browser local and remote version phrasing.
* uwt: Fixed a bug: &quot;''libtorsocks(18790): Could not open socks configuration file (/tmp/tmp.pKSaitLYTN) errno (13), assuming sensible defaults for Tor.''&quot;
* Deactivate automatic update check in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic. It is handled by whonixcheck. This makes fingerprinting Whonix users harder.
* whonix_createvm: Disable clipboard sharing at build time. Only matters if guest additions are installed which is recommended against. Just in case.
* whonix_release: Removed sha sums. New versions will no longer contain sha sums. A more secure method, gpg signatures are provided.
* Enabled auto login on tty1 for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.
* Added haveged, which is an entropy gathering daemon.
* adrelanos.asc: changed e-mail address from proper at secure-mail dot biz to adrelanos@riseup.net. Key otherwise unchanged. Fingerprint remains the same. There is no need to update. Just mail to the my current riseup e-mail address.
* Installing command-not-found.&lt;br /&gt;
* Removed redundant mdadm and lvm2 from package selection. Physical Isolation and other advanced users most likely know if they need those packages.

Whonix-Workstation

* easier to install [[Chat#torchat|TorChat]]
* pre-installed [[Mixmaster]], a tool to send e-mail without registering e-mail accounts
* easier to install TorBirdy
* pre-installed rawdog, an rss reader to read Whonix News Blogs
* autologin for kde user
* added [[Dev/Dummy Tor|Dummy Tor]] package
* whonixcheck: runs once a day.
* Leaktest script fixed.
* Added icons for whonix online readme, torbrowser, whonixcheck and timesync.
* installing kde-baseapps-bin package. It's required for KDE applications proxy settings. (Only for stream isolation, manually installed applications.)
* MAT, the [[Metadata]] Anonymisation Toolkit, now fully installed and therefore easier to use
* added GnuPG frontend: KGpg
* install accessibility tools
* install process manager: ksysguard
* Whonix-Workstation KDE settings:
** double click instead of single click
** kgpg settings hide user id and keyservers
** KGpg settings: Decided not to set hkp://2eghzlv2wwcq7u7y.onion as keyserver, because it was offline.
** Dolphin show menu bar
** Konsole unlimited scrollbag
** plasma-widget-folderview, which allows to show the content of the ~/Desktop folder on the desktop.
** kde desktop set to folderview by default to show desktop icons.
** set default wallpaper to /usr/share/wallpapers/stripes.png
** New icons and desktop shortcuts.
** Whonix specifc start menu default icons.
* new /home/user/.bashrc - adds displaying /etc/motd (contains password and help) and bash completion.
* removed leafpad and kate. added kwrite as editor.
* whonixcheck: show &quot;apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade&quot; again even if apper is available because apper has bugs. (unsigned package warning)
* torbrowser:
** wrapper script supports now -new-tab link.com, for example: torbrowser -new-tab https://www.startpage.com
** the script may no longer be run as root.
** can now be run as any user, not just as &quot;user&quot;, but this is untested. Only tested for user &quot;user&quot;.
** new -lang switch for language help.
** better error message if network is down and curl fails.
** more help if network is down or script is broken.
** added Tor Browser Updater icon
** added graphical progress meter.
** graphical user interface
** removed gpg key download code and move it to deprecated_code. Downloading the keys at Tor Browser update time from the keyservers was a relict from TorBOX times, where a build script created TorBOX. It was due to trust and space reasons to include only the gpg fingerprint and the gpg keyserver commands to download the key. Anyone using Whonix binary builds or source code without audit already trusts Whonix. Deploying the gpg public keys for Tor Browser download instead of downloading them from them keyservers adds no additional trust problem. Auditors can instead of comparing the gpg fingerprint, download they keys and compare them with the ones shipped with Whonix. Not relying on the keyservers will make the Tor Browser update script much more robust.
** better and less scaring error message if torbrowser script bug is ever caught.
** Creating tor-browser_&quot;$TB_LANG&quot;/Docs/version. Tor Browser changelog has been forgotten to update by upstream. https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/6122990d/ To play it safe and having a chance of finding out the installed version, we create a file ourselves to remember it.
** Fixed profile not found bug, in case Tor Browser wasn't fully loaded by hard coding to wait 30 seconds before trying to open extra tabs
* whonixcheck, torbrowser, htpdate: Notice Endless data attacks and Slow retrieval attacks by adding --max-time 300 to curl.

Whonix-Gateway

* package selection: installing tor-geooipdb. arm needs it to show countries.
* 0.4.5 undocumented: added settings to whonix_firewall, these were and are documented on the applications page
* whonixcheck
** now runs automatically at least every 24 hour on Whonix-Gateway as well.
** On Whonix-Gateway. Will now display the results when automatically run to all logged in users using the wall command.
** Also download whonix version and news file on the gateway for users using custom workstations.
* Fixed whonix_gateway/usr/local/bin/leaktest.
* Usability: arm can now be run without password.
* whonixcheck:

Source Code

* You can now just drop files inside the whonix_gateway, whonix_workstation or whonix_shared folders and don't need to add every single file inside int_copy_*.
* Faster debugging.
** new switch: whonix_createvm -t&quot;$MACHINE&quot;-copyimg required for building from source code...
** This eases debugging. Before we created the img using grml-debootstrap and directly copied into it and directly run the chroot script inside it. Creating a clean modification required to re-create the whole img using grml-debootstrap which always took a long time, even though using apt-cacher-ng. From now, only a copy of the img is modified. Using whonix_createvm -tg-copyimg (or -tw-copyimg) will copy the original img created by grml-debootstrap from /home/user/whonix_binary/&quot;&lt;math&gt;VMNAME&quot;.img  to /home/&quot;&lt;/math&gt;USERNAME&quot;/whonix_binary/&quot;&lt;math&gt;VMNAME&quot;_copy.img. Only/home/&quot;&lt;/math&gt;USERNAME&quot;/whonix_binary/&quot;$VMNAME&quot;_copy.img gets modified from now.;
** whonix_build: added -fast switch, which skips the -createimg step
* whonix_createvm:
** only set Workstation hardware clock to UTC.
** No longer setting Gateway hardware clock to UTC.
*** This is because Tor leaks it to entry guards (and bridges?).
*** torproject.org #7277: timestamp leaked in TLS client hello https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7277
*** torproject.org #4852: Clients send NETINFO with time https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4852
** Whonix-Gateway is therefore less fingerprintable.
* removed comment, pae is now documented in the faq
* added release folder, whonix_release file are still just notes, not a automatic script.
* new switches for mounting and unmounting images are tX-(un)mountimg and tX-(un)mountvdi
* start-tor-browser: comment fix. Added export in front of the TOR_TRANSPROXY, TOR_SOCKS_HOST, TOR_SOCKS_PORT variables. Fixes https://github.com/adrelanos/tbb-scripts/issues/1 Thanks to scruloose for reporting!
* torbrowser: found zenity workaround, therefore removed kdialog.
* whonixcheck: found zenity workaround, therefore removed kdialog.
* whonixcheck: removed old wget/uwt comments.
* htpdate: changed curl to /usr/bin/curl to circumvent uwt wrapper.

* torbrowser: gpg fingerprints are now inside variables. Fingerprints and how to verify them is now noted in echos.
* torbrowser: use more variables for download links. Now just one comment has to be removed to download from .onion instead.
* torbrowser: removed old out commented code for deleting stuff.
* torbrowser: simpler startup script creation method and fixed a quote bug.
* torbrowser: using rm --force to suppress error messages.
* torbrowser: deleting TorBrowser_installation_FAILED in case it was created earlier.

* Workstation package selection: added and unfortunately commented out software-center due to too many bugs which make it unusable http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=software-center
* Whonix-Gateway_packages, Whonix-Workstation_packages: added sysvinit-utils and bsdutils. Dependencies for whonixcheck.

= Whonix 0.4.5-fix2 =

[0.4.5-fix] for testers.

This is just a hotfix for torbrowser and whonixcheck. The Tor Browser locally installed version check was broken, because The Tor Project forgot to update the changelog and because the keyserver was offline.

This template is intended as a meta-template: a template used for constructing other templates. It is not meant for use directly in an article, but can be used on a one-off basis if required. See [[Help:Infobox]] for an introduction to infoboxes and information on how to design them. See [[:Category:Infobox templates]] for specific infobox templates.

=== Usage ===
Usage is similar to {{tl|navbox}}, but with an additional distinction. Each row on the table can contain either a header, or a label/data pair, or just a data cell. These are mutually exclusive states so if you define a row with both a header and a label/data pair, the label/data pair is ignored.

To insert an image somewhere other than at the top of the infobox, or to insert freeform data, use a row with only a data field.

==== Number ranges ====
To allow flexibility when the layout of an infobox is changed, it may be helpful when developing an infobox to use non-contiguous numbers for header and label/data rows. Parameters for new rows can then be inserted in future without having to renumber existing parameters. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;|header3  = Section 1
|label5   = Label A
|data5    = Data A
|label7   = Label C
|data7    = Data C
|header10 = Section 2
|label12  = Label D
|data12   = Data D&lt;/pre&gt;

It is also possible to automatically renumber parameter names by using [[Module:IncrementParams]].

Note that although there is no limitation on the number of rows available, row parameters should not be numbered more than 50 apart. See the [[#Limitations]] section below for more details.

=== Parameters ===

====View/discuss/edit links====
;name
:If this parameter is present, &quot;view/discuss/edit&quot; links will be added to the bottom of the infobox, pointing to the named template. You can use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

:However this is rarely what you want, because it will send users clicking these links in an infobox in an article to the template code rather than the data in the infobox that they probably want to change.

====Title====
{{Infobox
|title = Text in caption over infobox
|subheader = Subheader of the infobox
|data1 = (the rest of the infobox goes here)
}}
{{Infobox
|above = Text in uppermost cell of infobox
|subheader = Subheader of the infobox
|subheader2 = Second subheader of the infobox
|data1 = (the rest of the infobox goes here)
}}

There are two different ways to put a title on an infobox. One contains the title inside the infobox's border, the other puts it on top as a caption. You can use both of them together if you like, or just one or the other, or even neither (though this is not recommended).
;title : Text to put in the caption over top of the table.
;above : Text to put within the uppermost cell of the table.

====Optional content====
;subheader(n) : additional title fields which fit below {{{title}}} and {{{above}}}. Subheader parameters should not be spaced more than 10 apart.
;image(n) : images to display at the top of the template. Use full image syntax, for example &lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:example.png|200px|alt=Example alt text]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Image is centered by default. See [[WP:ALT]] for more on alt text. Image parameters should not be spaced more than 10 apart.
;caption(n) : Text to put underneath the images.
;header(n) : Text to use as a header in row n. Header and data parameters should not be spaced more than 50 apart.
;label(n): Text to use as a label in row n.
;data(n): Text to display as data in row n. Header and data parameters should not be spaced more than 50 apart.
;below: Text to put in the bottom cell. The bottom cell is intended for footnotes, see-also, and other such information.
;child: See the [[#Embedding|embedding]] section for details.

Note: for any given value for (n), not all combinations of parameters are permitted. The presence of a {{para|header''(n)''}} will cause the corresponding {{para|data''(n)''}}{{para|label''(n)''}} (and {{para|rowclass''(n)''}}, see below) to be ignored; the absence of a {{para|data''(n)''}} will cause the corresponding {{para|label''(n)''}} to be ignored. Valid combinations for any single row are:
*{{para|header''(n)''}} {{para|class''(n)''}}
*{{para|data''(n)''}} {{para|rowclass''(n)''}} {{para|class''(n)''}}
*{{para|label''(n)''}} {{para|data''(n)''}} {{para|rowclass''(n)''}} {{para|class''(n)''}}
See the rendering of header4, label4, and data4 in the examples section below.

====Optional CSS styling====
;bodystyle : Applies to the infobox table as a whole
;titlestyle : Applies only to the title caption. Adding a background color is usually inadvisable since the text is rendered &quot;outside&quot; the infobox.
;abovestyle : Applies only to the &quot;above&quot; cell at the top. The default style has font-size:large; since this cell is usually used for a title, if you want to use the above cell for regular-sized text include &quot;font-size:medium;&quot; in the abovestyle.
;imagestyle : Applies to the cell the image is in. This includes the text of the image caption, but you should set text properties with captionstyle instead of imagestyle in case the caption is moved out of this cell in the future.
;captionstyle : Applies to the text of the image caption.
;headerstyle : Applies to all header cells
;labelstyle : Applies to all label cells
;datastyle : Applies to all data cells
;belowstyle : Applies only to the below cell

==== HTML classes ====
;bodyclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox as a whole.
;titleclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox's title caption.
;aboveclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox's &quot;above&quot; cell.
; aboverowclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the complete table row the &quot;above&quot; cell is on.
; subheaderclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox's subheader.
; subheaderrowclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the complete table row the subheader is on.
;imageclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the image.
; imagerowclass(n) : These parameters are inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the complete table row the respective images are on.
;rowclass(n) : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the specified row '''including''' the label or other explanatory text.
;class(n) : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the data cell of the specified row. If there's no data cell it has no effect.
;belowclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox's below cell.

==== Microformats ====

This template supports the addition of microformat information. This is done by adding &quot;class&quot; attributes to various data cells, indicating what kind of information is contained within. To flag an infobox as containing [[hCard]] information, for example, add the following parameter:

&lt;pre&gt;
|bodyclass = vcard
&lt;/pre&gt;

And for each row containing a data cell that's part of the vcard, add a corresponding class parameter:

&lt;pre&gt;
|class1 = fn
|class2 = org
|class3 = tel
&lt;/pre&gt;

...and so forth. &quot;above&quot; and &quot;title&quot; can also be given classes, since these are usually used to display the name of the subject of the infobox.

See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Microformats]] for more information on adding microformat information to Wikipedia, and [[microformat]] for more information on microformats in general.

====Italic titles====
Titles of articles with infoboxes may be made italic, in line with [[WP:ITALICTITLE]], by passing the &lt;code&gt;italic title&lt;/code&gt; parameter.
*Turn on italic titles by passing {{para|italic title|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{italic title|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} from the infobox.
*Turn off by default but allow some instances to be made italic by passing {{para|italic title|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{italic title|no}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*Do not make any titles italic by not passing the parameter at all.

===Making fields optional===
A row with a label but no data is not displayed. This allows for the easy creation of optional infobox content rows. To make a row optional use a parameter that defaults to an empty string, like so:

&lt;pre&gt;
|label5 = Population
|data5  = {{{population|}}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This way if an article doesn't define the population parameter in its infobox the row won't be displayed.

For more complex fields with pre-formatted contents that would still be present even if the parameter wasn't set, you can wrap it all in an &quot;#if&quot; statement to make the whole thing vanish when the parameter is not used. For instance, the &quot;#if&quot; statement in the following example reads &quot;#if:the parameter ''mass'' has been supplied |then display it, followed by 'kg'&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;
|label6 = Mass
|data6  = {{#if:{{{mass|}}}|{{{mass}}} kg}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

For more on #if, see [[meta:ParserFunctions##if:|here]].

You can also make headers optional in a similar way. If you want a header to appear only if one or more of the data fields that fall under it are filled, one could use the following pattern as an example of how to do it:

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;{{Infobox
|name    = {{subst:PAGENAME}}
|title   = Example of an optional header
|header1 = {{#if:{{{item_one|}}}{{{item_two|}}}{{{item_three|}}}|Optional header}}
|label2  = Item one
|data2   = {{{item_one|}}}
|label3  = Item two
|data3   = {{{item_two|}}}
|label4  = Item three
|data4   = {{{item_three|}}}
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

header1 will be shown if any of item_one, item_two, or item_three is defined. If none of the three parameters are defined the header won't be shown.

The trick to this is that the &quot;if&quot; returns false only if there is nothing whatsoever in the conditional section, so only if all three of item_one, item_two and item_three are undefined will the if statement fail.

===Examples===
{{Infobox
|name         = 
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Test Infobox
|titlestyle   = 

|image        = [[File:example.png|200px|alt=Example alt text]]
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = Caption for example.png
|captionstyle = 
|headerstyle  = background:#ccf;
|labelstyle   = background:#ddf;
|datastyle    = 

|header1 = Header defined alone
|label1  = 
|data1   = 
|header2 = 
|label2  = Label defined alone does not display (needs data, or is suppressed)
|data2   = 
|header3 =
|label3  = 
|data3   = Data defined alone
|header4 = All three defined (header, label, data, all with same number)
|label4  = does not display (same number as a header)
|data4   = does not display (same number as a header)
|header5 =
|label5  = Label and data defined (label)
|data5   = Label and data defined (data)

|belowstyle = background:#ddf;
|below = Below text
}}

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto&quot;&gt;{{Infobox
|name         = 
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Test Infobox
|titlestyle   = 

|image        = [[File:example.png|200px|alt=Example alt text]]
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = Caption for example.png
|captionstyle = 
|headerstyle  = background:#ccf;
|labelstyle   = background:#ddf;
|datastyle    = 

|header1 = Header defined alone
|label1  = 
|data1   = 
|header2 = 
|label2  = Label defined alone does not display (needs data, or is suppressed)
|data2   = 
|header3 =
|label3  = 
|data3   = Data defined alone
|header4 = All three defined (header, label, data, all with same number)
|label4  = does not display (same number as a header)
|data4   = does not display (same number as a header)
|header5 =
|label5  = Label and data defined (label)
|data5   = Label and data defined (data)

|belowstyle = background:#ddf;
|below = Below text
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice how when a label is defined without an accompanying data cell the row doesn't appear in the displayed infobox, and when a header is defined on the same row as a data cell all of them are displayed.

{{clear}}
For this example, {{nowrap|bodystyle &amp;#0061; width:20em;}} and {{nowrap|labelstyle &amp;#0061; width:33%;}}

{{Infobox
|bodystyle   = width:20em;
|name        = 
|title       = Test Infobox
|titlestyle  = 
|headerstyle = 
|labelstyle  = width:33%
|datastyle   = 

|header1 = 
|label1  = Label 1
|data1   = Data 1
|header2 = 
|label2  = Label 2
|data2   = Data 2
|header3 = 
|label3  = Label 3
|data3   = Data 3
|header4 = Header 4
|label4  = 
|data4   = 
|header5 = 
|label5  = Label 5
|data5   = Data 5: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

|belowstyle = 
|below = Below text
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{Infobox
|bodystyle   = width:20em;
|name        = 
|title       = Test Infobox
|titlestyle  = 
|headerstyle = 
|labelstyle  = width:33%
|datastyle   = 

|header1 = 
|label1  = Label 1
|data1   = Data 1
|header2 = 
|label2  = Label 2
|data2   = Data 2
|header3 = 
|label3  = Label 3
|data3   = Data 3
|header4 = Header 4
|label4  = 
|data4   = 
|header5 = 
|label5  = Label 5
|data5   = Data 5: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

|belowstyle = 
|below = Below text
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{clear}}

===Embedding===
One infobox template can be embedded into another using the {{para|child}} parameter.  This feature can be used to create a modular infobox, or to create more well defined logical sections. Previously, it was necessary to use embedding in order to create infoboxes with more than 99 rows, but there is now no limit to the number of rows that can be defined in a single instance of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{infobox}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
{{Infobox
| title = Top level title
| data1 = {{Infobox|decat=yes
  | child = yes
  | title = First subsection
  | label1= Label 1.1
  | data1 = Data 1.1
}}
| data2 = {{Infobox|decat=yes
  | child = yes
  | title = Second subsection
  | label1= Label 2.1
  | data1 = Data 2.1
}}
|belowstyle = 
|below = Below text
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto&quot;&gt;
{{Infobox
| title = Top level title
| data1 = {{Infobox
  | child = yes
  | title = First subsection
  | label1= Label 1.1
  | data1 = Data 1.1
}}
| data2 = {{Infobox
  | child = yes
  | title = Second subsection
  | label1= Label 2.1
  | data1 = Data 2.1
}}
|belowstyle = 
|below = Below text
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note, in the examples above, the child infobox is placed in a &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; field, not a &lt;code&gt;header&lt;/code&gt; field.  Notice that the section subheadings are not in bold font if bolding is not explicitly specified. To obtain bold section headings, place the child infobox in a header field, either using
{{Infobox
| title = Top level title
| header1 = {{Infobox|decat=yes
  | child = yes
  | title = First subsection
  | label1= Label 1.1
  | data1 = Data 1.1
}}
| header2 = {{Infobox|decat=yes
  | child = yes
  | title = Second subsection
  | label1= Label 2.1
  | data1 = Data 2.1
}}
|belowstyle = 
|below = Below text
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto&quot;&gt;
{{Infobox
| title = Top level title
| header1 = {{Infobox
  | child = yes
  | title = First subsection
  | label1= Label 1.1
  | data1 = Data 1.1
}}
| header2 = {{Infobox
  | child = yes
  | title = Second subsection
  | label1= Label 2.1
  | data1 = Data 2.1
}}
|belowstyle = 
|below = Below text
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
or,
{{Infobox
| title = Top level title
| header1 = First subsection
  {{Infobox|decat=yes
  | child = yes
  | label1= Label 1.1
  | data1 = Data 1.1
}}
| header2 = Second subsection
  {{Infobox|decat=yes
  | child = yes
  | label1= Label 2.1
  | data1 = Data 2.1
}}
|belowstyle = 
|below = Below text
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto&quot;&gt;
{{Infobox
| title = Top level title
| header1 = First subsection
  {{Infobox
  | child = yes
  | label1= Label 1.1
  | data1 = Data 1.1
}}
| header2 = Second subsection
  {{Infobox
  | child = yes
  | label1= Label 2.1
  | data1 = Data 2.1
}}
|belowstyle = 
|below = Below text
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that omitting the {{para|title}} parameter, and not including any text preceding the embedded infobox, may result in spurious blank table rows, creating gaps in the visual presentation.

===Subboxes===
An alternative method for embedding is to use {{para|subbox|yes}}, which removes the outer border from the infobox, but preserves the interior structure.  One feature of this approach is that the parent and child boxes need not have the same structure, and the label and data fields are not aligned between the parent and child boxes.
{{Infobox
| headerstyle = background-color:#eee;
| labelstyle  = background-color:#eee;
| header1     = Main 1
| header2     = Main 2
| data3       = {{Infobox|subbox=yes
  | headerstyle = background-color:#ccc;
  | labelstyle  = background-color:#ddd;
  | header1     = Sub 3-1
  | header2     = Sub 3-2
  | label3      = Label 3-3
  | data3       = Data 3-3
}}
| data4         = {{Infobox|subbox=yes
  | labelstyle  = background-color:#ccc;
  | label1      = Label 4-1
  | data1       = Data 4-1
}}
| label5      = Label 5
| data5       = Data 5
| header6     = Main 6
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto&quot;&gt;
{{Infobox
| headerstyle = background-color:#eee;

  | labelstyle  = background-color:#ccc;
  | label1      = Label 4-1
  | data1       = Data 4-1
}}
| label5      = Label 5
| data5       = Data 5
| header6     = Main 6
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Full blank syntax ===
(Note: there is no limit to the number of possible rows; only 20 are given below since infoboxes larger than that will be relatively rare. Just extend the numbering as needed. The microformat &quot;class&quot; parameters are also omitted as they are not commonly used.)

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
{{Infobox
|name         = {{subst:PAGENAME}}

=== Limitations ===
Previously, the number of rows available to this template was limited to 99. This restriction has been lifted now that the template has been ported to a [[WP:Lua|Lua module]], but to maintain backwards compatibility there is now a limit on the number of rows apart by which parameters will be detected. If parameters are numbered more than 50 apart, the later parameters may be ignored (depending on the exact numbers involved), and if parameters are numbered more than 100 apart, the later parameters will definitely be ignored.

For example, this code will display properly:
&lt;pre&gt;|header3   = Section 1
|label48   = Label A
|data48    = Data A
|data92    = Data B
|label136  = Label C
|data136   = Data C
|header177 = Section 2
|label215  = Label D
|data215   = Data D
&lt;/pre&gt;

But in this code, only Section 1, Label A and Data A will be displayed:
&lt;pre&gt;|header3   = Section 1
|label48   = Label A
|data48    = Data A
|data102   = Data B
|label103  = Label C
|data103   = Data C
|header115 = Section 2
|label120  = Label D
|data120   = Data D
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that parameter values may be blank - parameters are counted unless they are completely absent from the template invocation. There are also similar limitations for image parameters and subheader parameters. In those cases parameters should not be numbered more than 10 apart.

=== Porting to other MediaWikis ===
The infobox template requires the [[:mw:Extension:Scribunto|Scribunto]] extension and [[mw:Manual:Using content from Wikipedia#HTMLTidy|HTMLTidy]] to be installed. It may not work with other MediaWikis. [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Transwiki|WikiProject Transwiki]] has a version of this template that has been modified to work on other MediaWikis.

= Threat Model =

== Note ==

The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt RFC 2119].

== The Threats ==

First let's quickly consider all the possible threats we could face. We can put threats against computer systems into five categories:

# Non-technical/non-computer-based and legal attacks E.g. &quot;rubber hose cryptanalysis&quot;, mandatory key disclosure, subpoena, real police work/espionage (done by real humans, not bots), bugs, surveillance cameras...
# Hardware attacks through physical access. RAM and Hard disk Forensics, keylogger, TEMPEST, Evil Maid attack...
# Backdoors Intentional weaknesses or additional hidden &quot;functionality&quot; put into your system by a manufacturer, vendor or distributor (hardware or software) allowing remote access&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Can be put in anywhere between design/source code, manufacturing/compilation or distribution.
# Vulnerabilities Coding or hardware design errors that can be exploited to gain remote access&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Vulnerabilities and Backdoors in practice can look exactly the same, only the way they are created differ.
# Design flaws Even in a backdoors-free, error-free system with perfect physical and legal protection (no such thing in reality) perfect security may still be impossible. This is especially true for anonymity systems. While with cryptography a perfect design exists (the one time pad) anonymity isn't binary. You are not either anonymous or not, you only have some non-zero but not-perfect degree of anonymity. Your anonymity depends on hiding amongst others. Anonymity networks require trust and a large and diverse userbase. A perfect security system wouldn't require trusting other parties or depending on such extraneous factors. Any design of a complex (but still usable) system (all computer systems are complex) needs to make tradeoffs. That's why pretty much everything uses non-perfect cryptography instead of the one-time-pad...

Bug [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5928 Research: IP discovery through Tor behind isolated network] seems to only be about learning the IP address which a Tor client connects to the Internet through. It doesn't mention other information leaks.

Footnotes:

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Used in the broadest sense, can be classic remote code execution, privilege escalation, DoS... Essentially they all allow remote parties to send your system instructions that diverge from the allowed security policy

== Attacker capabilities ==

* Legal/Non-technical &quot;attacks&quot; and physical access is expensive Anything that requires real humans to do work instead of letting computers and algorithms do it is prohibitively expensive against more than a small target group.
* Backdoors (hardware or software) are expensive It is hard to make one and it's risky. The more you use it the more likely it is it will be caught and closed. Adversaries are not going to waste it on anything but high profile targets. However, well hidden passive &quot;backdoors&quot; are of a concern, they can practically be impossible to detect and remain functional for years. Imagine a backdoor in a compiler affecting the PRNG. The cost for such backdoor is high (for this example an attacker need patience, non-trivial coding and social engineering as well as some crypto skills) but the &quot;ROI&quot; would be great too...
* Software attacks are cheap A good 0day can still cost a lot and isn't useful for very long once you start using it. But new vulnerabilities are found all the time, new exploits can be written. Compared to physical access and backdoors it is cheap. It can be fully automated against a large target set. If you are wondering how realistic or important the client application 0day threat is consider pwn2own 2012. A semi-legal but most certainly immoral and reckless company demonstrated how they can exploit every web browser circumventing all state of the art security features (MAC, Sandbox, ASRL, NX, etc). This is not too surprising, we already established how big code bases always have bugs and a subset of those bugs will always be exploitable. The noteworthy news here is that this company doesn't report their findings to the developers, they sell it to governments (and/or the highest bidder) as offensive &quot;cyber weapons&quot; (naturally not their term). It's only likely that also Tor vulnerabilities are sold behind closed doors. You MUST act accordingly and never rely on Tor alone if your threat model demands &quot;reasonably strong anonymity&quot; even from not-nearly-global but well funded adversaries.
* Crypto-attacks are enormously expensive If you know how to break currently used crypto you will try keep this a secret at all costs. Most crypto attacks will most likely require enormous computing power.
* Attacking design flaws: it depends... The costs can vary greatly but in every case, once you attack a design flaw and it becomes publicly known the target will fix the flaw and will become harder to attack in the future. This can result in an arms race and often neither party wants to go that way. A grave problem for the defender side can be that some systems are so widely used that it becomes almost impossible to mitigate away to a more secure design. The best example for that is the certificate authority system. It's design is flawed on so many levels yet it's relied upon, often solely for all authentication and confidentiality, to this day by pretty much everyone who's ever used a computer. Similarly, a lack of crypto and hash agility in many applications results in a dependence on weak and broken algorithms, not because we don't know any better but because backwards compatibility and some bad apples spoil it for everyone. There's certainly a threshold, were, if an attacker plays it slow and carefully, he can stay just below the radar for a long time and let everyone believe that it's not &quot;that bad yet&quot;. For example, a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#Attack_scenarios collision attack] against SHA-1 (which would affect software updates, version control systems as well as Tor, GPG, TLS and pretty much everything that uses public key crypto) is known to be &quot;within the reach of a powerful adversary&quot; since 2005, with Moore's Law and Schneier/NSA's Law (&quot;Attacks always get better; they never get worse&quot;) in play the range of potential adversaries only got larger. SHA-1 will probably be relied on pretty universally until someone publicly demonstrates a collision. Not because we don't know any better, but because to cost of switching are so high.

== Our Goals ==

* Hiding our Location and Identity when transmitting information
* Confidentiality, Integrity, Authenticity and Availability of transmitted data

== Our Attack Surface ==

Basically any part used by us to achieve our goals can be attacked:

* We REQUIRE physical security and privacy. It's obvious that anonymity and confidentiality is difficult or impossible to achieve otherwise.
* Tor, the code, the design, the whole network (see [[Dev/Anonymity Network]] for more) We also can't look at Tor as an isolated piece of software, we SHOULD consider its whole TCB because if any part of a TCB can be subverted the Tor process can be subverted. The attack surface in case of backdoors is the full TCB, in case of vulnerabilities &quot;only&quot; the network facing parts of the TCB.
** The Whonix-Gateway Hardware
** GNU/Linux/OS: kernel, essential userland, apt-get and all software update packages provided by the OS distributor/vendor
** Tor itself
** The build system (gcc...) Using Virtualization (instead of Physical Isolation) increases the TCB significantly. In addition to the above:
** Host Kernel
** Host applications
** Host software updater
** Virtualization software
* We REQUIRE software we use doesn't do more than absolutely necessary to reduce our anonymity set through protocol leaks, identity correlation through Tor circuit sharing and fingerprinting. For that we also have to rely on the Whonix-Workstation and the TCB of the applications we use. (for more see [Whonix's Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]).

For Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity we (we all, not just Whonix...) are still way too heavily dependent on TLS (Transport Layer Security, the &quot;s&quot; in https). Further we depend on:

* The complete Host (Hardware and Software)
* all software in Whonix-Workstation
* TLS/PKI infrastructure
* In case of hidden services: The full location/identity TCB.
* The &quot;other end&quot;, the security of whoever you are communicating with, unless it's symmetric key crypto and you got the only key.

To achieve Availability of information we depend on:

* the upstream internet provider, uptime and connectivity
* Tor network resilience against DoS
* resilience of webservers you connect to against DoS
* Your own system's resilience against DoS

== Applying the threat model to Whonix ==

First of all, you don't want to end up in the &quot;high profile target&quot; list of any of your resourceful adversaries. Because, if you do, neither Whonix nor any other computer based system can protect you.

Whonix is mostly a software project. There isn't a lot we can do on the hardware and physical side of things. Hardware security would be a much smaller problem if we weren't using monolithic systems where dozens of parts have full system access through DRM (or indirectly though hardware drivers that all run in kernel space). Have a look at Qubes OS for state of the art hardware deprivileging. It requires modern hardware, &lt;s&gt;software support still needs to catch up&lt;/s&gt; and a bigger user base, therefore this isn't available in Whonix yet, although it shouldn't be hard to port Whonix to Qubes OS if anyone were willing to do it.

We assume the hardware is trustworthy, we assume the physical location is not compromised. We RECOMMENDED to use &quot;clean&quot; computers made of parts manufactured by reputable companies and to pay in cash so as to not have hardware IDs leak our identity.

To protect against forensic analysis we SHOULD on the host use full disk encryption and wipe the RAM on shutdown.

* Implementation status: Because Whonix doesn't include a host operating system yet, we RECOMMEND users to do that themselves in Whonix documentation.

Further some pointers:

* DMA is bad, IOMMU is good, avoid attaching untrusted (or any for that matter) devices on FireWire and PCI* interfaces.
* Use open source hardware or at least open source friendly that makes specifications public. Open source means that multiple companies can implement the hardware, the Linus law of &quot;many eyeballs and all bugs are shallow&quot; applies, backdoors are harder to hide.
* Simple is beautiful, complexity is the enemy Nr.1 of security. Whonix-Gateway could run on very simple hardware like the Raspberry Pi.

Crypto is even worse, the only thing we can do is to use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_encryption cascades] of different cipher and hash families. This is slightly more complicated than it sounds and we don't know of any software that does it right.

As established above in &quot;Attacker capabilities&quot; the main attack vector we need to concern (and we can actually do something about) is software attacks.

To protect against software backdoors and vulnerabilities:

* The source needs to be audited, preferably by yourself and many others and should ideally be bug free. Popular open source projects are your best bet. Whonix is fully open source, anyone can audit and patch.&lt;br /&gt;
* If you rely on others (you do), you need to make sure that you get the same code as everyone else Hash sums + signatures, the more public they are, the better. If completely transparent signing is used (as common in proprietary systems) it's much more difficult to determine that you get the same files as everybody else. By default signing is only concerned with making sure that you get code by someone with access to the key. This protects against 3rd parties but not insiders. Checksums and signatures of Whonix and updates are publicly available.
* The code you use SHOULD have a good track record, know issues must be corrected immediately. Code that doesn't get checked but has zero known problems is worse than code that has hundreds of known and patched security issues but is constantly being reviewed and worked on. However, a trustworthy code should have very few if any security issues despite having been audited thoroughly. After all, projects that constantly need security patches are constantly insecure. But it's not really about numbers, check the severity of the bugs. Linux needs many security patches but fatal flaws that would affect Whonix are few and far between (i.e. remote code execution with root privileges). Fatal flaws in user facing applications (like browsers, pdf readers, media players, IRC) are frequent and therefore such software is not be part of the TCB (see below).
* Checking the source is not enough, you need trustworthy binaries. Analyzing binaries is a lot more difficult than analyzing source code. If you rely on source code auditing you absolutely REQUIRE a trustworthy compiler (and a complete trusted system to run it on) and use [http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/ DCC]. Similarly you already need a trusted system to check signature and hashes. This is the bootstrapping chicken and egg problem we mentioned earlier. Generally, to address it you need to use at least two different diverse systems that are completely independent (includes their parent build system and compiler) and set up the system in such a way that both would have to be compromised by the same adversary in a compatible way in order to result in a fatal security breach.

If the code base is huge and complex code auditing isn't a realistic strategy, therefore we need to reducing complexity and attack surface by:

* making the TCB small and
* using privilege separation: The TCB for identity/anonymity is as small as it gets on a monolithic general purpose OS. It could be smaller (e.g. a custom kernel, busybox, uclibc instead of libc and gnu-utils) but that comes at the cost of maintainability, security updates and ease of use. (And still leaves us with a comparably huge monolithic kernel and a gigantic gcc infrastructure.) Linux/Xorg (with DAC or even MAC) isn't very good with privilege separation (e.g. no trusted path). The strongest privilege separation is offered by using multiple physical computers, that's what we RECOMMEND, [[Physical Isolation]] and [[multiple Whonix-Workstations]]. The more practical, but less secure alternative is virtualization. For details about privilege separation between IRC/Browser/Clients and Tor see [[Dev/Technical Introduction]]

We've thought a lot about making Whonix yet more secure but with the (free and open source) tools available today it doesn't seem possible. What we'd need is an isolation kernel, that would offer some strong guarantees of isolation between the different subsystems and ideally would be verified, so you don't have to worry about sophisticated backdoors (apart from the compiler, see &quot;Trusting trust&quot;/chicken and egg), software vulnerabilities and even some hardware backdoors and vulnerabilities (through IOMMU and microkernel design one can put hardware and firmware components, apart from the CPU, out of the TCB). For Fingerprint/Protocol leaks and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_triad#Key_concepts CIA Triad] we are depending on the Whonix-Workstation TCB. This is a hopelessly large TCB/attack surface. For this reason we use yet another approach which can be called &quot;security through non-persistence&quot;. That is, you should extensively make use of the snapshot and roll back feature of the virtual machine. Instead of privilege separation within a Tor-Workstation (e.g. by using a Mandatory Access Control framework) which would come at great usability costs, we recommend to use the coarse-grained isolation provided through multiple VMs (also see [[Advanced_Security_Guide#About_grsecurity]]).

To protect against software attacks (vulnerabilities) in particular:

* make software hard to attack ASLR, canaries, NX, kernel hardening, (See the Debian section [[Dev/Operating System#About Debian|About Debian]]. Note that this makes attacks &quot;harder&quot; but not impossible. Hardening is no replacement for fixing bugs. In a really trustworthy system hardening would not be necessary.

To mitigate Design flaws, the primary strategy is eliminating single points of failure. You SHOULD NOT rely on Tor alone, use wifi or tunnel through another system running VPN. You SHOULD NOT rely on TLS alone, use GPG as well (and vice versa). You SHOULD NOT rely on a software monoculture, you SHOULD NOT have to rely on Debian infrastructure to never be compromised. We are currently guilty of not following this advice. To lessen the impact of a potential compromise of the update infrastructure (which includes developer machines, build systems, key security and cryptographic primitives like PRNG - remember openssl or Flame?) we do not enable automatic software updates. After all, they are essentially remote root level backdoors (although with some checks in place).

=== Notes about securing Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity ===

This is no different than in any other computer system without Tor. You MUST use end to end public key encryption, there is not really an alternative to that. But there are alternative implementations: TLS, SSH, GPG... End-to-End means, both ends need to be secure, one end is the Whonix-Workstation, which you can control and secure. In case of hidden services, the Whonix-Gateway is ALSO part of the TCB!

Whonix-Workstation isn't specifically hardened because hardening a Desktop system to a degree that makes it actually secure against a serious adversary makes the system unusable. Instead we follow the nuke and restore approach, see [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]] and [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots|Recommendation to use multiple Snapshots]].

About Availability: The most resilient approach is probably a distributed data store, like Tahoe-LAFS or Freenet. i2p offers multi-homing built in. For Tor we don't know of any solutions ready for general usage.

Moved to [[Hidden_Services#Notes_about_End-to-end_security_of_Hidden_Services]]

== Attack on Whonix ==

There is a comparison of TBB, Tails, Whonix Standard/Download version (host+VM+VM) and Whonix with Physical Isolation in chapter [[Comparison_with_Others#Attacks|Attacks against Whonix]].

== Design Document, innovations and research ==

Whonix developer adrelanos is also interested in serious design documents. There is only one design documents with respect to Tor, transparent/isolated proxying, isolation and Virtual Machines. Adrelanos has read the old design paper &quot;A Tor Virtual Machine Design and Implementation&quot; from 2009, which can be found at [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/DesignDocumentBase Design Document Base]. After reading, adrelanos forked that paper, removed non-essential, non-security relevant stuff and made sure, all considerations from the old design paper, were implemented into Whonix. The forked paper can be found at [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/DesignDocument/ Design Document].

The whole Whonix [[Documentation]] and [[Design]] supersede the old design document. Also the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO TorifyHOWTO] is co-maintained by adrelanos.

Also the following documents are being monitored.

* [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/index.en.html Tails Design]
* [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/ Tails Design: specification and implementation]
* [http://dee.su/liberte-security Security and Anonymity in Liberté Linux]
* [http://dee.su/liberte-motivation Liberté Linux Motivation and Philosophy]

If there are any security/privacy/anonymity updates they will be considered for Whonix.

The Whonix project also enjoys asking good questions, providing useful suggestions and creating useful things.

The following list is to keep track of all discussions and to review them in the future again, to see if something has changed.

== Whonix Threat Model not available as pdf or paper version ==

You may skip this optional chapter. Written by Whonix developer adrelanos.

While I read real papers, like the [https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf Onion routing design paper] and many others, I can't be coerced into creating a paper &quot;Designing an anonymous operating system&quot; with latex as pdf.

Like Mike Perry, developer of Tor Browser [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024405.html said] &quot;''I find the pdf format heavy and unnerving from a security perspective.''&quot;. That also goes for adrelanos and I also find the pdf format inconvenient. It would also take me some time to learn latex, pdf creation, formatting etiquette and so on. Time, which I rather invest into improving the design, developing and so on. The &quot;Onion routing design paper&quot; is now also outdated and I rather have an editable, often updated and revised website compared to a paper/pdf.

Tails does also not have a design paper as pdf and still lots of users and developers. Also TrueCrypt had not design paper about plausible deniability and still got reviewed by Bruce Schneier et al. Therefore I really don't see the benefits of having the threat model available as pdf, but if I have overlooked something, please don't hesitate telling me.

== The World Wide Web and your privacy ==

For sure, you can no longer imagine day-to-day life without the World Wide Web. Those numerous services such as online banking, travel information, encyclopedias, and the like mean great convenience in solving common tasks. Furthermore, you probably surf entertainment and shopping portals, stay in touch with friends over social networks or share your common interests with others in forums. To access the Web you are offered dozens of stable, highly functional, yet easy to use applications: Web Browsers. The most popular browsers are Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Apple's Safari and Google Chrome.

Any communication on the Internet leaves all kinds of digital traces behind which can be automatically acquired, saved and analyzed. Some companies have thus specialized in creating individual user profiles from surfing-related data. These databases are of high economic value since they allow an enterprise to comprehensively profile their customers: that means you. This process is called data accumulation or [http://www.eos-solutions.com/en/solutions/marketinginformation/data-enhancement/ data enhancement] in computer lingo, &quot;data mining&quot;.

There are many reasons why one should avoid leaving digital traces when surfing: part of the data collected finds its way into credit scoring systems which are used to evaluate loan requests, to create individually priced offers or to decide on eligibility for C.O.D. service. Employers may create or request a character profile of their job applicants from traces on the Net prior to hiring them. Freedom of opinion is limited by governments or institutions that track individuals and what they read and say. These entities may even deny access to certain web pages or services. Companies may recognize employees of other businesses or even those of their competition and subsequently harass them with promotional calls or email spam. Browser-related data exposes vulnerabilities in the surfing machine. An hacker may subsequently establish communications with the computer directly and attack it.

Further problematic is that these traces '''are collected, saved, sent and processed without your consent and most likely without your knowledge.''' Decisions about you may be based on this information.

In the following section we briefly introduce three popular companies collecting and mining data.

=== Google ===

It is generally known that Google's business model is based on the collection of data and the analysis thereof. But many users have no conception regarding the comprehensiveness of personal profiles and the worth of these data.

'''Economic figures:''' According to an estimation done by experts there are ca. 1.5 million servers working for Google in different data centers. Every three months that amount is growing by 100,000. The annual costs of this infrastructure are approximately 2 billion dollar. Google's overall revenue is about 30 billion dollar every year with an annually profit of 7 billion dollar. 96 percent of Google's revenue is generated by personalized advertisements. (as at 2009)

The whole infrastructure may be used for free. It is not paid by money but by data. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Google is logging the traffic which can be linked to a particular person unambigously examining various characteristics. This affects the deployment of the search engine, of Google services like YouTube or Google Earth and applies as well to flashing advertisements on other web sites and of course to tracking tools like Google Analytics. The basic data is combined to comprehensive profiles of individual users surfing the web. Due to its popularity Google is almost able to capture the whole searching and surfing behavior. In Germany 89 percent of search requests go directly to Google. Besides, 85 percent of german web sites are contaminated with elements (Google Analytics, flashing of advertisements et cetera) allowing Google to track users across multiple web pages.

How exact and comprehensive Google's personal profiles are is hard to say. As a basis to estimate this one can use the data the company is providing to its advertisement partners. The following figure shows the aggregated statistics of a not further mentioned web site:

[[Image:google-chart.png|frame|none|alt=|caption Visitor Statistics]]

Besides age and gender Google is able to estimate the education level and income of almost all web surfers. Additionally, there are their interests, political orientation and contact addresses (e-mail, instant messaging) that are not mentioned here but nevertheless collected by Google as well. As the Wall Street Journal writes in an [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703940904575395073512989404.html analysis] there are even ways to assess the likelihood of a payment by credit card. The researchers Bin Cheng und Paul Francis from Max Planck Institute for Software Systems show that it is possible to [http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/10/more-privacy-headaches-for-facebook-gay-users-outed-to-advertisers.ars ferret out gay users by anaylizing clicks on advertisements]. Their method can be adapted to any kind of questions and may for instance be used to deliver individual advertisements.

The tracking and observation of users can be detected especially good in the case of [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting retargeting]. If one does not buy anything while visiting a web shop one is often overwhelmed with advertisements of similar products in the aftermath. Google is offering a special AdSense program with retargeting.

=== RapLeaf ===

The company [https://www.rapleaf.com/ RapLeaf] is collecting data profiles via e-mail addresses. The data is not used for personalized advertisements. Rather, it is just sold. As a potential buyer one is passing a list of e-mail addresses to RapLeaf and gets the profiles back (according to the comprehensiveness intented) after paying the bill. The following is a short abridgment out of the price list (as at 2011):

* Age, Gender and Location: 0 Cent (loss leader)
* Household income: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Marital Status: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Presence of Children: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Home Market Value: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Loan-to-Value Ratio: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Available Credit Cards: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Cars in Household: 1 Cent per e-mail address
* Likely Smartphone User: 3 Cent per e-mail address
* Occupation and Education: 2 Cent per e-mail address
* Blogger: 3 Cent per e-mail address
* Charitable Donor: 3 Cent per e-mail address
* High-End Brand Buyer: 3 Cent per e-mail address
* Interested in Books/Magazines: 3 Cent per e-mail address
* ...

The data is gathered by correlating e-mail usage with surfing behavior or obtained via the time and time again happening data leaks at online merchants' platforms. One of the main investors is [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Peter_Thiel Peter Thiel], who founded PayPal and is co-determining the development of Facebook in the background in a significant way. It has to be assumed that RapLeaf uses data collections of these internet companies as well. Furthermore, data stemming from Twitter and other data bases offering commercial access is included into the processing.

=== Facebook ===

'''Economic figures:''' The &quot;social net&quot; Facebook is supposed to have 600 million users worldwide. The stock exchange value of the company is estimated to 50 billion dollar and the profit was 353 million dollar in 2010. The earnings amount to 4-5 dollar for every user in one year. (as at 2011)

Facebook is for free and the user's data is the basis for the commercial success as well. Data that is entered intentionally and in a controlled way is only playing a minor role here. Far more important is the information extracted out of the users' behavior. This data and the derived information is not controlled by users. But they have agreed to a commercial use of them when they registered themselves.

==== Connections between friends ====

The contact relationships of users are analyzed with different goals in mind. First of all they are used for friend-2-friend advertisements. Many users are not aware of the fact that they serve as an advertising medium. The targeted advertising gets improved by [http://www.wu.ac.at/press/institutes/entrep/downloads/publikationen/kratzer_lettl_jcr_2009.pdf identifying opinion leaders in contact networks] that get addressed (e.g. in order to publish sponsored stories).

Another way of analyzing contacts is demonstrated by [http://mashable.com/2009/09/21/facebook-friends-sexual-orientation/ Gaydar]. Looking at the contacts in Facebook profiles MIT students extracted the sexual orientation of the respective account owner. Such kind of information could influence a career.

==== Analyzing gaming behavior ====

Facebook offers different games for its members like &quot;Farmville&quot; or &quot;Mafia Wars&quot;. The moves of the participants are analyzed and character traits are derived. The profiles are then commercialized. Companies can buy profiles of potential applicants.

==== Facial recognition ====

Publishing private pictures is one of the most popular activities on Facebook. Meanwhile a software for facial recognition is deployed. According to Facebook several million persons are identified on uploaded pictures daily.

With it a huge database is created which shall be used commercially. In the future, customers entering a shop could get identified by a camera and the salesman could access a comprehensive personal profile (for money).

''&quot;Show us 14 photos of yourself and we can identify who you are. You think you don't have 14 photos of yourself on the internet? You've got Facebook photos!&quot;'' said Eric Schmidt (then CEO of Google) on the Techonomy conference August 4, 2010.

==== Secret services, army and law enforcement agencies ====

Public authorities and secret services are using the information provided by Facebook and snoop in the users' private lifes. The Israeli military [http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=196426 is scanning Facebook profiles of Israelis dodging the draft]. Secret services of other countries are acting more aggressively. The Agence Tunisienne d'Internet (ATI) used &quot;Javascript Injection Attacks&quot; in order to get the login data of suspected activists. Their profiles got owned and scanned for evidence. The result were detentions based on these data.

==== Privacy policy ====

&quot;''Mir sind keine Datenschutzbestimmungen von Facebook bekannt, die diesen Namen verdienen. Es handelt sich um Nutzungsregelungen, die grob nach dem Muster ablaufen: Du Nutzer bist für alles verantwortlich, was Du bei uns machst. Und wir dürfen mit den Daten dann alles machen, was uns gefällt.''&quot; (Dr. Thilo Weichert, data protection commissioner of Schleswig-Holstein (Germany))

Translation: &quot;''According to my information there is no privacy policy that deserves its name. It is all about terms and conditions that are roughly working like this: You user are responsible for everything you are doing here. And we may do with the data everything we like to do.''&quot;

Facebook is going to be a &quot;net within the net&quot; with orwellian visions.

=== Twitter ===

'''Economic figures:''' Twitter has an estimated amount of 200 million users. Every single user causes costs of about 1 dollar a year. (as at 2010)

Contrary to Google and Facebook Twitter did not manage it to use the data itself profitably. The earnings out of the advertisements fell far short of expectations.

Twitter's business model is selling access to its database. Twitter is providing 40 parameters (content, location, date, account, used software, language, retweets...) for every Tweet. Paying 60,000 dollar a year one can access 5 percent of the Tweets, paying 300,000 dollar a year one can access the whole database. Twitters database is a rich source of information that may not be found somewhere else for market research purposes, advertisements or secret services.

|description=Surveillance Capabilities, Technological Capabilities of Adversaries for Surveillance
}}
= Surveillance Capabilities =

In order to develop proper means for anonymity, one must estimate the technological capabilities of adversaries (typically corporations, criminals, repressive government). If you are not too technologically or scientifically educated, or if signal intelligence sounds somewhat mythical to you, then you will be rather challenged in trying to properly assess such capabilities, distinguishing facts from fantasy.

First, a simple overview. A highly technologically capable adversary (e.g., a military counter-intelligence unit) can:

* intercept your internet traffic, including e-mail, instant messaging, VoIP, and Wi-Fi connections (though the latter doesn't directly involve ISPs)
* intercept your phone and fax communications, including landlines, cell phones, satellite phones, and radio telephone extensions (the latter doesn't involve telecommunications providers (&quot;telcos&quot;))
* associate your geographic location with a cell phone IMEI number or with a SIM card number
* reliably associate your calls with your voice patterns (speaker recognition)
* associate your geographic location with your digital financial transactions

This passive surveillance can be performed constantly and concurrently for a large number of people (who are not specifically suspected of anything), and all data gathered can be retained indefinitely. We see that the technological resources of a modern adversary are virtually unlimited, and any task that can be automated is implemented and deployed.

However, the non-technological resources of an adversary are definitely limited. The adversary cannot:

* break modern encryption protocols
* perform active surveillance on non-suspects (e.g., break into computers) -- the chances of being caught are too high.
* have human officers or employees read or listen to large amounts of communication
* recognize your face from a satellite (although [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle UAVs] are a different story)
* have large quantities of qualified human resources.

|description=Surf, Blog and Post anonymously on the Internet. Essential knowledge to avoid detection.
}}
= Anonymous Surfing, Posting and Blogging =
== Introduction ==
Tor Browser is installed to surf the Internet anonymously. It is optimized to surf the Web securely and anonymously and therefore configured in a rather restricitve way. Please, read the [[Tor Browser]] article for basics.

== Posting, Blogging anonymously ==
Whonix-Workstation contains all necessary tools to run a blog anonymously. Some hints:

* For a anonymous blog you need a new and anonymous e-mail address (see separate [[E-Mail]] article] for registering the blog and possibly the communicationi first. Register a new address and use this address only in regard to your blog. Always use Tor to login into this e-mail account.
* You may register your blog at different providers anonymously. For example you could use https://wordpress.com/. Keep always the option to pay anonymously (e.g via BitCoin or cash cards, ex. Paysafecard) in mind if you are using a premium product. (See [[Money]] page.) Note that cash card codes differ by country and could theoretically also contain an ID to specific in which shop they have been bought. Usually you may administrate your blog using a web interface only. Always use Tor for all activities concerning your blog.
* A browser is no safe environment to write stuff. You could accidentally paste things you don't want to paste. You could trigger a search for text that you did not intend to sent into the Internet. While you type, the server already knows what you type. It's another question if they are already collecting and using that information. It's better to be careful. Otherwise it would reveal, how fast you type, how long your breaks are, which mistakes you make while writing the draft and while you mistype, also which type of local keyboard you are using. Write the text in an offline text editor such as KWrite and copy and paste the text into the blog interface once you are done.
* Mind your cookies! Remember to empty your browser's cookie and history cache periodically. When you are using [[Tor Browser]], which is recommended for many reasons anyway, simply close Tor Browser after you are done working on your blog, then restart it. For more advanced separation use [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]].
* Attention should be given to the password-retention policy of the browser. If the browser supports a master password that encrypts every password it saves, use that feature. It is however best not to save your blog password in the browser.
* Every blog software offers the option to select the point in time when new postings shall be published. Do not publish a new posting &quot;at once&quot; but rather choose a point in time when you are not online anymore. &lt;ref&gt;This will trick adversaries, who can not force the blog service provider to reveal the fact, when and for how long you log in. It won't trick the blog service provider.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Generally, before uploading to the blog pictures and other documents must get anonymized. Usually, pictures contain a unique camera id in the meta tags, which may deanonymize you, and perhaps GPS (location) coordinates. See [[Metadata]] for more information.
* Stylometry (deanonymization using your spelling style) is already an inherent part of secret service means. It is possible using (semi) automatic techniques to correlate anonymous postings to an author if the circle of suspects is sufficient small and if there are enough text examples of them. Concentrating and taking one's time while writing a blog post allow to fake one's spelling style though.
* Use a spell checker to confuse Stylometry a bit. You could use KWrite. To start it, use Start menu button -&gt; Applications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Text Editor (KWrite). Once KWrite is open, click on Tools -&gt; Automatic spell checking. Mistyped words will be underlined with red color.

|description=How to Start Whonix and Troubleshooting Whonix Startup Issues
}}
= Starting Whonix =

[[Image:11_click_start.png|Showing VirtualBox with correctly imported Whonix Virtual Machines. RAM setting may differ.|thumb]]

Starting Whonix is simple. Start VirtualBox -&gt; double click on the '''Whonix-Gateway''' and '''Whonix-Workstation'''.

If you need more help with starting, there are [[Videos|Video Tutorials]] (which explains installing and starting).

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;([[Videos#Video_Help|Video Help]])&lt;/font&gt;

If you still need help, please go to the [[https://www.whonix.org/forum|Whonix User Help Forum]].

'''The default username is:''' '''''user'''''

'''The default password is:''' '''''changeme'''''

= Whonix does not start? =
== PAE crash ==
If Whonix does not start because PAE is missing:
Virtual Box -&gt; Right Click on Whonix-Gateway -&gt; Settings -&gt; Processor -&gt; Disable the ''Enable PAE/NX'' Box -&gt; OK.

Repeat that for Whonix-Workstation as well.

Read the [[#Boot Options|Boot Options]] chapter and use the 486 kernel.

== VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE ==
If you see &quot;{{Code2|Failed to load unit 'PATM' (VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE).}}&quot;, please enable VT-x in BIOS.

== Kernel Panic ==
This probably similar to PAE crash and VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE issues above. If you can, enable VT-x in BIOS. If you can't deactivate PAE/NX in VirtualBox (see PAE crash above for instructions on how to do so) and then read the [[#Boot Options|Boot Options]] chapter and use the 486 kernel.

== Other reasons ==
Please have a look at the [[Download]] page. It contains instructions on how to properly download and verify the Whonix virtual machine images. There is also help available in form of screenshot or video instructions.

If you still need help, please go to the [https://www.whonix.org/forum Whonix User Help Forum].

= Boot Options =

In the grub boot menu you can choose for two seconds. Two kernels are installed by default.

* The default 686-pae kernel.
* A 486 kernel for compatibility.

'''If Whonix works out of the box, you do not need to change anything''' and you can stick to the default 686-pae kernel.

In case you need to [[#PAE_crash|disable PAE]], use the 486 kernel.

|description=Real World Examples that are Protected by using Whonix
}}

= Whonix security in real world =

[[Image:flash_leak_test.png|Flash Leak Test SocksPort and TransPort|thumb]]

[[Image:flash_leak_test_both_transport.png|Flash Leak Test both TransPort|thumb]]

Some real world examples that are '''protected by using Whonix''':

* Flash and Java, although recommended against, cannot leak IP/location. See [[Browser Plugins]] for details.
* Skype, although recommended against, cannot leak IP/location. See [[Voip#skype|Skype]].
* BitTorrent, when using ordinary proxyfication methods, has been [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea reported to protocol IP leak] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FDaBuhHi w]). Although recommended against due to excessive traffic and therefore harming the Tor network (see [[File Sharing]]), cannot leak IP/location. This is because the external ISP IP address is hidden from Whonix-Workstation.
* [https://tails.boum.org/security/IP_address_leak_with_icedove/index.en.html Tails: Icedove (Thunderbird) leaks the real IP address] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FDZcatic w]) - Whonix didn't exist at the time that bug existed. These kinds of leaks are impossible in Whonix, since the Whonix-Workstation is unaware of its external IP. To be fair, these kinds of leaks are now much less likely in Tails, since they are no longer using transparent proxying. ([https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-September/001704.html source] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FDZe0ZXS w]))
* [https://tails.boum.org/bugs/pidgin_leaks_the_real_IP/ pidgin leaks the real IP] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FDZj1gpN w]) - Whonix didn't exist at the time that bug existed. These kinds of leaks are not possible with Whonix, since the Whonix-Workstation is unaware of its external IP. To be fair, it should be noted that this bug existed only in the development source code. They spotted the bug and fixed it before the release. ([https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-September/001704.html source] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FDZe0ZXS w]))
* [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/firefox-security-bug-proxy-bypass-current-tbbs Tor Browser Bundle: Firefox security bug (proxy-bypass)] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FDZlP2Ht w]) - This vulnerability was circumvented by Whonix. Any proxy bypass may have only emitted traffic through Tor's TransPort. All that could have been leaked is the IP address of another Tor exit relay, which is harmless.
* clock skew attack ([http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/10usgv/clock_skewing_a_clever_unconventional_means_of/ link]) ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FDZnhH5j w]) brief summary: The adversary gets the time of a hidden server (example: http header) and measures the skew. Then the adversary compares with Tor relays or other publicly reachable (web) servers. If they have the same skew, it's very likely it's hosted on the same server. - Although it's recommended against to run a Tor relay/publicly reachable server and a hidden service on the same server (because that opens up a lot other attacks (bandwidth, DDOS related)), Whonix 0.4.4 and above circumvent this attack. To be fair, when this attack was first described Whonix didn't exist, but it would circumvent it now.
* [http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00574178/en/ Exploiting P2P Applications to Trace and Profile Tor Users] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FVK6WpNu w]) - Whonix didn't exist at the time that attack was first described. This attack gets defeated by Whonix, since the Whonix-Workstation is unaware of its external IP and because Whonix makes extensive use of [[Stream Isolation]].
* [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html Tor security advisory: Old Tor Browser Bundles vulnerable] A vulnerability opened up for remote code execution in Firefox and Tor Browser if JavaScript was enabled (which was the default setting in Firefox and Tor Browser at time of writing). TODO: expand. See also [[Special:AWCforum/st/id50|Forum discussion]].

|description=Security Reviews and Feedback, Whonix in the Media
}}

= Security Reviews and Feedback =

If you want to get listed here or feel something is missing, please get in contact.

== Audits ==

* [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023531.html cursory check of TorBOX by creator of JanusVM]

== Official expert review ==

None, but that doesn't mean anything. There is nothing of that kind about Tails or Liberté Linux as well. Is there even something of that kind about Debian, Ubuntu or Qubes OS?

I am not aware of any serious research about any of such distributions in [http://freehaven.net/anonbib/ anonbib]. No one like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier Bruce Schneier] for cryptography exists for distribution review.

More food for thought on the audit, users are sometimes asking for. Has GNU wget been audited? What is an audit? Is it an professional company, providing software security audits as a service? Some kind of certification? In the Open Source world, adrelanos hasn't found such a thing. If you know examples, please get in contact or edit this section. Do you expect to come someone reputable come up, say something like &quot;I carefully audited GNU wget and haven't found any security vulnerabilities&quot;? It looks like it works quite the other way around. When someone audits the code and finds nothing wrong, nothing will be reported. On the other hand, if a vulnerability has been found, that's worth some fame. The one who claimed beforehand to have found nothing, however, wouldn't get better reputation.

'''If you make an audit, please edit this section or get in contact so it will be linked here.'''

== Vulnerabilities ==
=== Debian ===
Any vulnerabilities in Debian packages, which Whonix is based on, also affect(ed) Whonix.

=== Whonix ===
* On 2012-04-02 on old TorBOX homepage in old TorBOX 0.1.3 a vulnerability was reported by (now) Whonix developer adrelanos. See Old News, 2012-04-02 in [[History]]. '''FIXED'''
* No other vulnerabilities have been ever reported by third parties.

== Official Whonix Online Profiles ==

There are some [[Official Whonix Online Profiles]].

== First public discussions ==

There are [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/subject.html#23489 a few older threads] on the Tor Talk Mailing List about the security of Whonix / transparent proxy.

* [tor-talk] Operating system updates / software installation behind Tor Transparent Proxy&quot;
* [tor-talk] Obtain real IP behind Tor transparent proxy; was: Operating system updates / software installation behind Tor Transparent Proxy
* [tor-talk] Risk with transparent proxy mode [was Re:Operating system updates / software installation behind Tor Transparent Proxy] - Summary: coderman (developer of TorVM / JanusVM) had some concerns, which could be cleared. &quot;Looks fine from a cursory check.&quot;

== Older TorBOX article ==

* [http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/browse-email-safely-anonymously-torbox/ makeuseof.com: Browse &gt; Email Safely &gt; Anonymously With TorBOX]

== Older places of people talking about Whonix ==

A section to collect everyone discussing Whonix anywere. It's nice to see what people think and say about Whonix. If they don't give feedback directly, we still have a secondary feedback source. Most links are found through googeling &quot;TorBOX&quot; or &quot;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX&quot;.

Old questions on torproject.org:

* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/Dev/ArchivedDiscussion/QUESTIONS Dev/ArchivedDiscussion/QUESTIONS]

Unsorted:

* [http://utup22qsb6ebeejs.onion/?x=entry:entry120219-220943 &quot;My Hidden Blog&quot;]; (adrelanos) small blog entry; unfortunately not much information or feedback
* [https://thepiratebay.se/tag/torbox Whonix on theprivatebay.de]; (adrelanos) Interesting but pointless imo. 6 seeders right now in total. People should not even trust us but they trust the packager of that torrent. I am not against sharing through torrent. It's all Free Software. As long we do not offer trusted and gpg signed builds, however I recommend against downloading through torrent.

= Secondary DNS Resolver =

== Introduction ==
By Whonix default, Tor is used for DNS resolution. If you suspect a Tor exit relay to tamper with DNS, you can get a second opinion from another non-Tor DNS server. This may also be useful, in special cases if you want to resolve types of DNS over Tor, which are unsupported by Tor itself, such as MX &lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;(required for some [[Mixmaster]] servers over Tor)&lt;/font&gt; or DNSSEC.

It's recommended against to use non-Tor DNS resolvers for an extended amount of time. Although it's technically possible to completely replace DNS resolution (not using Tor for DNS resolution anymore), it's recommended against. That would add too much power to a single DNS server. Using a permanent DNS server is recommended against just as using a permanent Tor exit relay is recommended against.

Note, that even if you correctly set up all settings, it might happen that this won't work. Sometimes Tor or the DNS server causes a timeout. This gets even worse, when you additionally tunnel the DNS request through an additional proxy (for example: Tor -&gt; JonDonym -&gt; DNS server).

Read first: [[Stream Isolation]].

Required knowledge:

* Difference between encryption and authentication.
* {{TorifiedGateway}} (&lt;-- read the footnotes)

In the chapters below are examples how to use authenticated DNS ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions DNSSEC]) or encrypted DNS (DNSCrypt or httpsdnsd). &lt;s&gt;I haven't found any public DNS resolvers supporting both, encryption and authentication.&lt;/s&gt; https://cloudns.com.au/ seems to support both, authentication (DNSSEC) and encryption (DNSCrypt).

Note that most applications, such as [[Tor Browser]], will '''not''' ''automatically'' profit from setting up an alternative DNS resolver. This is because applications in Whonix are configured to use SocksPort instead of Trans- or DnsPort, see [[Stream Isolation]] for details. Another reason is, that most applications do not yet make use of authenticated DNS (DNSSEC). However, you could use encrypted DNS when deconfiguring socks proxy settings and when using system resolver (TransPort).

== Authenticated DNS over Tor ==

=== DNSSEC over Tor ===

==== Example with CZ.NIC Labs DNS resolver ====

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt; [https://labs.nic.cz/page/993/dnssec-validation-over-tor--linux-/ source for this chapter: CZ NIC LABS] &lt;/font&gt;

The ''CZ.NIC Labs DNS resolver'' has been chosen as an example. Feel free to use and other DNS resolver at your own choice.

===== Installation =====

Install [https://unbound.net/ unbound] and [http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/ socat].

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install unbound socat&lt;/pre&gt;

Open ''/etc/unbound/unbound.conf''.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/unbound/unbound.conf&lt;/pre&gt;

''Add'' the following lines.

&lt;pre&gt;
#tcp-upstream goes under &quot;server:&quot; section
    tcp-upstream: yes

#put forward-zone somewhere at the end of file
forward-zone:
    name: &quot;.&quot;
    forward-addr: 0.0.0.0@5353
&lt;/pre&gt;

===== Starting =====

Open a terminal and start socat.

&lt;pre&gt;socat TCP4-LISTEN:5353,bind=localhost,reuseaddr,fork SOCKS4A:192.168.0.10:217.31.204.130:53,socksport=9150&lt;/pre&gt;

Open another terminal tab and restart unbound.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service unbound restart&lt;/pre&gt;

===== Using =====

Test with dig.

&lt;pre&gt;dig +dnssec nic.cz @localhost&lt;/pre&gt;

Please refer to upstream documentation on how to interpret the DNSSEC test results.

== Encrypted DNS over Tor ==

=== Introduction ===

This is different from DNSSEC.

=== DNSCrypt by OpenDNS ===

Although the official [https://www.opendns.com/technology/dnscrypt/ DNSCrypt website] states, that a Linux version does not exit, this [http://www.webupd8.org/2012/02/encrypt-dns-traffic-in-linux-with.html blog post] suggests there is one.

This has nothing to do with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions DNSSEC], the differences of DNSSEC and DNSCrypt are well explained on the [https://www.opendns.com/technology/dnscrypt/ DNSCrypt website].

These instructions completely replace Tor's DNS resolver with opendns's dnscrypt for all users and the whole system. Not recommended for a longer amount of time, see warning above. Some hints are included how to do it only for a specific user account.

(1). Download the [https://github.com/opendns/dnscrypt-proxy/downloads dnscrypt source code] and unpack. You have to compile it. Get into the dnscrypt directory ''cd dnscrypt-proxy-...''. Configure ''./configure'', make ''make''.

(2). Start dnscrypt-proxy. &lt;ref&gt;''--tcp-only'' is required since Tor does not support UDP. The UDP DNS request will immediately get truncated reply and a RFC-compliant resolver should repeat same query via TCP in this case. This is the case for Ubuntu's default DNS resolver. You can get some more information on UDP/TCP/DNS on the unrelated [http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks/ redsocks] website.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;To start it later in background (after debugging) add ''--daemonize''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''--help'' to see all options.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Start up takes a few seconds &quot;INFO Generating a new key pair&quot;, this is normal, wait. Until it's done, DNS will not work.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''--user=username'' can and should be used to start the dnscrypt-proxy under a specific user account.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Since this instructions completely replace Tor's DNS resolver with opendns's dnscrypt for all users and the whole system, you could add ''--local-port=5800'' to let dnscrypt-proxy listen on port 5800. You would be able to add iptables rules to redirect only the DNS requests of a specific user account to opendns's dnscrypt, you can get some hints how to do that in the ''httpsdnsd by JonDos'' chapter below, which would be a very similar setup.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;sudo dnscrypt-proxy --tcp-only&lt;/pre&gt;

(3). Edit your resolv.conf ''nano /etc/resolv.conf'', comment out everything and add ''nameserver 127.0.0.1''.

(4). Check if it's working, there are several [https://www.opendns.com/support/article/64 test pages] on opendns.com.

(5). To shut it down you can use ''sudo killall dnscrypt-proxy'' and don't forget to revert the changes in /etc/resolv.conf.

=== httpsdnsd by JonDos ===

==== Introduction ====

Source: [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/transocks.html anonymous-proxy-servers.net] and also use it as a more verbose tutorial, but keep in mind that their tutorial is JonDonym specific, while this tutorial is Tor specific.

Everything inside your Whonix-Workstation.

==== Installation ====

Install dependencies.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install libnet-ssleay-perl libnet-server-perl libnet-dns-perl libxml-simple-perl liblog-log4perl-perl&lt;/pre&gt;

Download httpsdnsd. (See source above in case download link changed.)

&lt;pre&gt;wget https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/downloads/httpsdnsd.tar.bz2&lt;/pre&gt;

Unpack.

&lt;pre&gt;.    &lt;/pre&gt;

Go into the httpsdnsd folder.

&lt;pre&gt;cd httpsdnsd&lt;/pre&gt;

Install httpsdnsd. &lt;ref&gt;It contains also a uninstall.sh, if you want to uninstall it later.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;sudo install.sh&lt;/pre&gt;

Add a new user for httpsdnsd.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo adduser --system --disabled-password --group httpsdns_daemon&lt;/pre&gt;

Editing /etc/resolv.conf is not required. (You still could out comment everything against DNS leaks.)

Create a firewall script.

&lt;pre&gt;nano dns-fw.sh&lt;/pre&gt;

Insert these firewall rules.

&lt;pre&gt;
# Flush old rules
iptables -F
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -X

# Redirect DNS traffic to httpdnsd.
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp -m owner --uid-owner anonuser --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 4053

# Accept connections to the httpdnsd.
iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p udp -m owner --uid-owner anonuser --dport 4053 -j ACCEPT

# Reject all other traffic for anonuser.
iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT ! -o lo -m owner --uid-owner anonuser -j REJECT
&lt;/pre&gt;

Install Privoxy. &lt;ref&gt;[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/OptionalConfigurations?version=95#httpsdnsdbyJonDos torproject.org Wiki Version 95] of this site contains a working example using Polipo. Changed later to Privoxy, because Privoxy can be useful for other tasks as well. (Incoming: TransPort, http proxy; forwarding: http and socks.)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install privoxy&lt;/pre&gt;

Open the privoxy configuration file.

&lt;pre&gt;nano /etc/privoxy/config&lt;/pre&gt;

Add the following to your privoxy configuration file.

&lt;pre&gt;
# Theoretically you can tunnel through any
# http or socks proxy. Local or remote proxy.
# Inside Whonix-Workstation, due to design,
# everything will be tunneled through Tor first.

# Using Tor's socks5 proxy, running on Whonix-Gateway. 
# Change the port, see above...
forward-socks5 / 192.168.0.10:9112 .

# Another example using a http proxy.
# (In this case, JonDo running on localhost.)
# forward / 127.0.0.1:4001
&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart privoxy to enable the changes.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/privoxy restart&lt;/pre&gt;

Privoxy is now listening on 127.0.0.1:8118. &lt;ref&gt;For debugging you can enter this IP/port into Tor Browser as http proxy and try if you can still reach check.torproject.org. Deactivate after testing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Starting ====

Run httpsdnsd. &lt;ref&gt;For debugging, kill httpsdnsd and drop the ''--runasdaemon''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Run ''httpsdnsd --help'' or ''man httpsdnsd'' for help.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Httpsdnsd will by default listen on localhost port 4053 for DNS queries.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''--https_proxy_port=8118'' will redirect traffic to port 8118, where Privoxy is listening. This is necessary because Tor offers a socks proxy and httpsdnsd requires a http proxy. Privoxy translates from http to socks.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;sudo httpsdnsd --https_proxy_port=8118 --runasdaemon&lt;/pre&gt;

Activate the firewall. Shouldn't show any errors.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo ./dns-fw.sh&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Using ====

Open a console and switch to anonuser.

&lt;pre&gt;su anonuser&lt;/pre&gt;

Resolve DNS.

&lt;pre&gt;nslookup check.torproject.org&lt;/pre&gt;

= Supported Host Operating Systems =
* Almost any... Whonix runs on any device capable of running VirtualBox.
* Windows
* Linux
** Almost any should work.
** [[Pre_Install_Advice#Which_host_operating_system_do_you_recommend.3F|Which host operating system do you recommend?]]
** Debian Wheezy '''recommended''' and known to work.
** Ubuntu '''recommended against'''&lt;ref&gt;Was lately negatively perceived due to privacy issues, so it's recommended against to use it as host operating system as well. [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/privacy-ubuntu-1210-amazon-ads-and-data-leaks Privacy in Ubuntu 12.10: Amazon Ads and Data Leaks]&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Prior 11.10 untested.
*** Stable versions are recommended.
*** 12.04 LTS and 12.10 are known to work.
* BSD

= System Requirements =
* For Whonix-Default-Download at least 1 GB free RAM is required. If you system has in total 2 GB RAM, Whonix should run fine. The more the better.
* CPU: AMD-V&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#AMD_virtualization_.28AMD-V.29&lt;/ref&gt; or Intel VT-x&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_.28VT-x.29&lt;/ref&gt; would speed up Whonix a lot. If you do not have it and run into a PAE or &quot;{{Code2|VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE}}&quot; error please read [[Starting Whonix#PAE crash|PAE Crash]].
* 10 GB disk space, better 15 GB or 20 GB or more depending on what applications you like to install.
* See also [[Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter]].
* Minimum 1024x768 desktop resolution for terminal (before the desktop environment starts) set in /etc/default/grub, unless manually reduced.
* 128 MB RAM for Whonix-Gateway without graphical desktop environment. Or 768 MB RAM for Whonix-Gateway with graphical desktop environment
* 768 MB RAM for Whonix-Workstation with graphical desktop environment. (Or &lt;ref&gt;128 MB RAM for Whonix-Workstation without graphical desktop environment.&lt;/ref&gt;.)

|description=How to Report (Security) Bugs to the Whonix Operating System
}}

== Normal Bugs ==
If you find bugs, please report them to the [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues Whonix github issue tracker].

They will be reproduced, confirmed, discussed, workaround posted, fixed in Whonix source code, etc. as fast as possible.

== Security Vulnerabilities ==
It would be nice if you were to report the bug privately using OpenPGP encrypted mail before publishing it. That would allow Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer to fix the bug and to credit your findings after the next Whonix release.

See [[Contact|Contacting Whonix developers / Feedback / Questions]].

== Usage details ==
For information about the parameters in this template, see [[Template:Infobox software/doc]]. A number of elements of this template, however, need further explanation:

'''Family''' - This is the operating system family, examples include [[Microsoft Windows]],  [[Unix-like]] and [[Mac OS]]. ''Linux'' and ''Mac OS X'' are not OS families.

'''Source model''' - This field is should usually have &quot;Open source&quot; or &quot;Closed source&quot;. Do not use &quot;free software&quot;, &quot;free and open source software&quot; or &quot;FOSS&quot; as they are mainly licensing models and may or may not use the &quot;open source&quot; development methodology.

'''Kernel type''' - For Linux distros, this should be &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Linux kernel|Linux]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It should not be the name of a distro.

== Example ==

--NOTES
--
-- NOTE A1: This Lua module was originally designed to handle a mix
--      of citation styles, crossing Vancouver style with Wikipedia's
--      local Citation Style 1 (CS1) from {Template:Citation/core}.
--      However, the conflicting positions of parameters, scattered
--      in twisted locations across this module, led to a separate
--      variation just to untangle the CS1 format of citations.
--
-- NOTE D2: The placement of dots and other separators between the
--      displayed parameters has been a continual headache, to keep
--      coordinated with the data in parentheses &quot;(data)&quot;. There
--      has been a need to pre-check for the existence of related
--      options, to keep from putting double-dots &quot;..&quot; in some cases.
--      In particular, the omission of the &quot;title=&quot; parameter has led
--      to several cases of a spurious dot &quot;. .&quot; because the original
--      design had treated the title as a mandatory parameter.

|description=Anonymous E-Mail. Remailer over Tor. Tunnelling remailer through Tor. Connection Schema: user -&gt; Tor -&gt; remailer -&gt; recipient
}}

= Remailer =

== Introduction ==

Quoted from the Wikipedia Anonymous remailer article&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_remailer&lt;/ref&gt;: &quot;''An anonymous remailer is a server that receives messages with embedded instructions on where to send them next, and that forwards them without revealing where they originally came from.''&quot;

In Whonix-Workstation, remailers can be used over Tor. Not with the goal to offer even more anonymity for (web) e-mails than Tor could provide, just as a cheap tool to send mails without registration.

In theory, remailers or to be more concrete, high latency networks are more secure than low latency networks like Tor. If you are interested in this, please see [[Dev/Anonymity Network]]. The anonymity provided by the remailer would add up to the anonymity provided by Tor. Given the facts, the there is almost no activity activity (press, blog posts, forum, mailing list discussion, development ceased) it's easy to assume that remailers have very few remaining servers and users.

In practice, it's safer to assume that so few people are using remailers, that they provide no additional anonymity. Adrelanos would enjoy seeing high latency networks reborn, unfortunately there is absolutely no implication that this is going to happen.

For this reason, for faster delivery and better reliability it makes sense to use only one remailer and not a chain of them. Of course, if you believe remailer chains will make you even more anonymous you are free to use any path length. By the way, if you want to use a remailer for anonymity, you shouldn't test the remailer by sending a remailed mail to yourself.

Depending on what you want to do, it is recommended to encrypt the content of your mail. &lt;ref&gt;Otherwise the last (or only) remailer and the recipient's mail provider could read it.&lt;/ref&gt; '''TODO''': what about the subject? Empty? &quot;&quot;? &quot;-&quot;? Random?

You can install and use remailer software directly inside Whonix-Workstation over Tor, which is the better way. Another method is using a Third Party Webinterface (at the bottom of this page), which is less secure, because the owner of the website could monitor how you type, metadata (send when, to whom) and cleartext (unencrypted content) communication.

A small test with Mixmaster using only one remailer revealed that it takes between 10 and 120 minutes until the mail arrives in the recipients inbox.

== Mixmaster ==

Fully documented on its own [[Mixmaster]] page.

== Third Party Webinterface in Tor Browser ==

Note that everything said in introduction applies and additionally the server administrator can read plaintext as you type or paste. Use with care, perhaps for lower security needs.

== Cypherpunk remailer ==

This may be wrong, feel encouraged to check if I am correct.

Although there is a big Cypherpunk remailer wikipedia article&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk_anonymous_remailer&lt;/ref&gt; and list of Cypherpunk remailer servers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noreply.org/echolot/rlist2.html&lt;/ref&gt;, cypherpunks.to/remailers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cypherpunks.to/remailers/&lt;/ref&gt; says it's using Mixmaster and the helpfile&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cypherpunks.to/remailers/help.txt&lt;/ref&gt; explains, that it's safer to use Mixmaster and that Cypherpunk remailer is just an e-mail based interface. Since the full list of typ I and typ II remailer servers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noreply.org/echolot/&lt;/ref&gt; reveals, that most type I (Cypherpunk) are also type II (Mixmaster) servers, I don't see much point into learning and documenting how Cypherpunk remailer works. It doesn't look like an alternative, i.e. doesn't look like Cypherpunk remailer could be used if Mixmaster doesn't work for some reason. It would also defeat the point of this page: sending mails without registration, because you would still require a mail provider.

|description=Whonix's Relationship with Upstream Projects.
}}
= Why this document? =

The [https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Guidelines Debian Derivatives Guidelines] encourages &quot;derivative distributions to mention and define their relationship with Debian&quot;. Because this seems like a great idea to me, I wrote this statement that not only covers Whonix's relationship with Debian, but also Whonix's relationship with any one of its upstream projects.

= Summary =

For various reasons Whonix tries to diverge by the smallest possible amount from its upstream projects, and especially from Debian:

* Adrelanos wants to share his work with the rest of the Free Software community.
* Adrelanos values maintainability very much: I believe my users are best served if I keep the amount of work needed to maintain Whonix the smallest possible.

= How =

== Debian specific ==

=== Derivatives Census ===

[http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census/Whonix Whonix participates in the Derivatives Census.]

=== Infrastructure ===

Debian Derivatives Guidelines recommends ''&quot;We encourage derivative distributions to use Debian infrastructure and the software that powers Debian infrastructure where possible.&quot;''.

Whonix makes heavy use of that. Only official Debian repositories are used. Adrelanos is very thankful, that Debian derivatives are allowed to do so. The Whonix project has neither the infrastructure, the founding nor the manpower to run its own repositories.

=== Debian packages ===

Neither binary nor source packages are modified.

=== Keyrings ===

Whonix does not modify keyrings.

Adrelanos's GPG key is copied into Whonix virtual machines at build time. It is only used to ensure authenticity of Whonix News.

=== Releases ===

See [[Dev/Operating System#About Debian|About Debian]] for reasons to choose Wheezy. When Wheezy gets stable, Whonix will be based on stable. Depending on user feedback Whonix will remain based on stable. Depending on user feedback and stability of testing, Whonix might be based on testing.

=== Trademark ===

Whonix is and will never be called Debian. It must always be clear that Whonix is a Debian derivative or based on Debian.

Adrelanos e-mailed trademark at debian.org and briefly explained Whonix. Debian Leader Stefano Zacchiroli said, there will be no trademark issues as long as Whonix will not claim to be Debian, which will of course never happen.

=== De-/Re-branding ===

Not necessary. See Trademark above.

=== Bug reports ===

Reportbug is unchanged. No Debian packages are modified. This still needs discussion.

=== Popularity Contest ===

Not installed in Whonix. Reasons are in the [[Operating System#Popularity Contest|Popularity Contest]] chapter.

== General ==

=== Upstream software ===

When my technical skills and time allows, I try to push my changes upstream when we need to modify software I ship. Only package selection, configuration files and scripts are modified.

=== Upstream Bug tracking systems ===

All bugs found in Whonix, will be checked, if they also apply to upstream. If that is the case, adrelanos will look if the bug has already been reported. If adrelanos can contribute something constructive, he will do so. In case there is not yet a bug report, adrelanos will report.

The same goes for wishlist/enhancement requests.

For what this is useful: PPTP is used because it's very easy to configure and well supported by all kind of devices. Compared to a proper set up with a hardware gateway between the internet and the devices you want to torify it's less secure but doesn't require any kind of hardware or network layout changes.

''''''Description''''''

VPN ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vpn Virtual private network]) is a method for users to connect to another network and access resources that can be seen from that network.

In this case, VPN is used to allow other users on your local LAN to connect and use your Whonix to connect to Tor with minimal configuration. Unlike Tor-VM where all network connections are forced through Tor or rejected, workstations connected over PPTP are NOT automatically protected against network level leaks and application level exploits.

We use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pptp PPTP] here due to its wide install base (every installation of Windows since Windows 95 includes a client) and ease of installation. Be aware of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pptp#Security_of_the_PPTP_protocol enormous security issues with PPTP].

'''Warning''', PPTP should '''NOT''' be used with Whonix over the Internet, only for local trusted sources. See below for an OpenVPN implementation that allows use of Tor with minimal client configuration and should be secure enough to allow Internet connections (coming soon).

''''''VPN: Bypassing Censorship &amp; Enabling Free Speech''''''

Ref: ([http://en.flossmanuals.net/bypassing-censorship/ch025_what-is-vpn/ How to Bypass Internet Censorship @ Flossmanuals.net])

Because VPN services [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_tunnel tunnel] all Internet traffic, they can be used for e-mail, instant messaging, Voice over IP (VoIP) and any other Internet service in addition to Web browsing, making everything that travels through the tunnel unreadable to anyone along the way.

If the tunnel ends outside the area where the Internet is being restricted, this can be an effective method of circumvention, since the filtering entity/server sees only encrypted data, and has no way of knowing what data is passing through the tunnel. It has the additional effect of making all your different kinds of traffic look similar to an eavesdropper.

We use VPN here for its “tunnel” capabilities, so that others that you allow access, can take advantage of Tor via Whonix with a single connection.

= Install PPTPd =

(Whonix-Gateway)

From your Whonix-Gateway:

&lt;pre&gt;apt-get install pptpd&lt;/pre&gt;

This will install and start the &lt;code&gt;pptpd&lt;/code&gt; daemon on your Whonix-Gateway. Verify its running:

&lt;pre&gt;ps aux | grep pptpd&lt;/pre&gt;

Should show something similar to:

&lt;pre&gt;root      8357  0.0  0.5  10512   696 ?        Ss   17:26   0:00 /usr/sbin/pptpd&lt;/pre&gt;

Stop it for the time being, while we configure it.

&lt;pre&gt;/etc/init.d/pptpd stop&lt;/pre&gt;

= Configure PPTP =

(Whonix-Gateway)

Configure PPTP settings:

&lt;pre&gt;nano /etc/pptpd.conf&lt;/pre&gt;

Setup your &lt;code&gt;localip&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;remoteip&lt;/code&gt; settings:

&lt;pre&gt;localip 192.168.0.1 #your eth1 address
remoteip 192.168.0.200-250 #a range of unassigned IP's&lt;/pre&gt;

See the [http://poptop.sourceforge.net/dox/pptpd.conf.txt official documentation here].

'''Discussion:'''

This can be potentially confusing, as the documentation in the configuration files are not the best. When you setup a PPTP connection, your Whonix-Gateway will setup a virtual adapter (e.g. ppp0) which will output traffic sent from your client computer (those that connect to your server from your local LAN) to the Whonix-Gateway and allow it to be routed through Tor. So if we want to use this virtual adapter just like a real adapter (e.g. eth0), we need to give it an IP address. That's what the &lt;code&gt;localip&lt;/code&gt; option is.

&lt;code&gt;remoteip&lt;/code&gt; is a bit simpler. It's the IP address (or addresses) that are assigned to the client's computer when they connect. They get their own virtual adapter, which needs its own IP address.

See the [http://poptop.sourceforge.net/dox/qna.html#19 FAQ here for information]. For a simple overview of the VPN process see [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VPNClient#Extra_credit:''how''VPN_works VPNClient @ Ubuntu Community Documentation].

'''localip''', for simplicity should be the IP of your eth1, as Tor is already configured to listen here and we don't actually do any routing creating an IP address conflict. '''remoteip''', should be several IP's on your internal network (you should have as many IP's as potential clients, for example the “192.168.0.200-250” range above defines IP's for 50 clients)

(Advanced: &lt;code&gt;localip&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;remoteip&lt;/code&gt; can be set to other networks, other subnets, etc. With our approach it doesn't matter what their IP's are, simply that they exist. It is in fact encouraged that such clients be assigned to a “quarantine” network. Since we don't have routing enabled, other subnets would prevent your client's from seeing each other and your already established “safe” LAN; where your Whonix-Workstation lives. But! The &lt;code&gt;torrc&lt;/code&gt; would need to be updated to listen on said addresses as well. Subneting in this fashion is beyond the scope of this document.)

= Configure PPTP Options =

(Whonix-Gateway)

&lt;pre&gt;nano /etc/ppp/pptpd-options&lt;/pre&gt;

Verify the following settings are configured as shown:

&lt;pre&gt;refuse-pap
refuse-chap
refuse-mschap
require-mschap-v2
require-mppe-128
ms-dns &lt;eth1 address&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Discussion:''' [http://poptop.sourceforge.net/dox/options.pptpd.txt See official documentation here].

'''refuse-pap''': [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_authentication_protocol PAP style authentication], insecure, so we don't want to use it if we can help it. '''refuse-chap''': [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-Handshake_Authentication_Protocol CHAP authentication], insecure. '''refuse-mschap''': [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSCHAP MS-CHAP], insecure '''require-mschap-v2''': [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSCHAPv2 MS-CHAPv2], make sure that any connecting client must use this. It's as secure a we can get for a supported authentication method for PPTP. '''require-mppe-128''': [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPPE Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption], as secure encryption as we can get over PPTP, 128 bit is the maximum supported. '''ms-dns''': Use this address as the DNS server for connecting (Windows) clients.

= Configure IPtables rules for client connect and disconnect =

(Whonix-Gateway)

The &lt;code&gt;ip-up&lt;/code&gt; script is called on each connection by a PPTP client, so we can put special firewall rules here to help with Torifying the traffic through this interface.

&lt;pre&gt;nano /etc/ppp/ip-up&lt;/pre&gt;

Add to the end:

&lt;pre&gt;#Firewall rules to add to route PPTP through TOR
#Tor's TransPort
TRANS_PORT#&quot;9040&quot;

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $PPP_IFACE -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $PPP_IFACE -p tcp --syn -j REDIRECT --to-ports $TRANS_PORT&lt;/pre&gt;

The variable “$PPP_IFACE” is defined in the script (see the documentation at the beginning of the ip-up script) and resolves to the name of the interface established after a PPTP connection (e.g. ppp0).

Similarly the &lt;code&gt;ip-down&lt;/code&gt; script is called when tearing down the connection. To prevent your iptables from getting polluted with redundant rules, we remove the previously configured rules here:

&lt;pre&gt;nano /etc/ppp/ip-down&lt;/pre&gt;

Add to the end:

&lt;pre&gt;#Firewall rules to add to route PPTP through TOR
#Tor's TransPort
TRANS_PORT#&quot;9040&quot;

iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i $PPP_IFACE -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53
iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i $PPP_IFACE -p tcp --syn -j REDIRECT --to-ports $TRANS_PORT&lt;/pre&gt;


Notice the addition of the '''-D''' instead of '''-A''' to the rule definitions. This tells &lt;code&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt; to Delete a rule with those parameters rather than Add one.

([http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/karmic/man8/iptables.8.html See IPTables documentation])

= Testing =

(Whonix-Gateway)

Start up your PPTP server:

&lt;pre&gt;/etc/init.d/pptpd start&lt;/pre&gt;

(Client)

From a client on your network (preferably one outside of your Tor network, e.g. not your Whonix-Workstation) connect to your VPN server.

Instructions for a variety of clients:

[http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/documentation.phtml Linux (many flavors, direct from the pptp-client site)] [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314076 How to configure a connection to a virtual private network (VPN) in Windows XP] [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VPNClient VPNClient @ Ubuntu Community Documentation] [http://www.pcworld.com/article/210562/how_to_set_up_vpn_in_windows_7.html Windows 7 VPN step by step guide]

Now verify the connection on the gateway, after successfully connecting: (Whonix-Gateway)

&lt;pre&gt;ifconfig&lt;/pre&gt;

Should show something like:

&lt;pre&gt;ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
    inet addr:192.168.0.1  P-t-P:192.168.0.200  Mask:255.255.255.255
    UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1496  Metric:1
    RX packets:91 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
    TX packets:71 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
    collisions:0 txqueuelen:3
    RX bytes:10080 (10.0 KB)  TX bytes:3622 (3.6 KB)&lt;/pre&gt;

.

&lt;pre&gt;iptables -vnL -t nat&lt;/pre&gt;

Should show:

&lt;pre&gt;Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 103 packets, 14589 bytes)
pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source                   destination                                          
    0     0 REDIRECT   udp  --  ppp0  *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0 udp dpt:53     redir ports 53
   22  1320 REDIRECT   tcp  --  ppp0  *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0 tcp     flags:0x17/0x02 redir ports 9040&lt;/pre&gt;

(You may have more information displayed here depending on configuration, but the lines above should at least appear in your PREROUTING chain)

(Client)

On the client you should then be able to connect via Tor.

* Browse to &lt;code&gt;check.torproject.org&lt;/code&gt; and verify the “congratulations” message

Next disconnect from the VPN. On the server you should see several changes: (Whonix-Gateway)

* &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; should no longer show any ppp interfaces
* &lt;code&gt;iptables -vnL -t nat&lt;/code&gt; should show no rules that involve any ppp interfaces

You can in fact test several client connections in this way. Each should get a new IP address (192.168.0.201, 192.168.0.202, etc), create a new virtual adapter (ppp1, ppp2, etc) and route through Tor via the Iptables commands (as above).

You can also attempt [LeakTests Leak Testing] to verify that no packets are leaking through your VPN connection.

|description=Comparison and Consideration of various Operating Systems as base for the Whonix Anonymous Operating System. Design Documentation.
}}

= Operating System =

== Introduction ==
This chapter applies to the host(s), Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

''Whonix Example Implementation'' is currently based on Debian. There were development discussions about switching to [http://qubes-os.org Qubes OS], BSD, Alpine Linux or other secure operating systems.

Whonix can't protect against malicious code inserted into upstream operating system infrastructure. Debian ensures some chain of trust as it requires contributors to sign commits.

== Why don't you use &lt;your favorite most secure operating system&gt; for Whonix? ==
Why do you use Debian, and not...

The operating system must have

* acceptable usability
* must be somewhat popular, because only that leads to sufficient public scrutiny and enough available documentation.
* For redistribution of Whonix, there may also not be any legal/trademark issues such as with Ubuntu. (See &quot;Switch from Ubuntu to Debian&quot; chapter below).
* Must have a secure operating system updater (package manager), i.e. must not fall through the [https://www.updateframework.com/wiki/Docs/Security#AttacksandWeaknesses TUF Threat Model] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6F7Io2ncN w]). Not having a secure updater is [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/apple-took-3-years-to-fix-finfisher-trojan-hole/ very dangerous] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6FULk4z8t w]).

Debian is a good compromise of security and usability.

By the way, this chapter won't only include examples which fall through Whonix's threat model.

Why not use a minimal Linux distribution? See [[FAQ#Why_are_the_Whonix_images_so_big.3F|Why are the Whonix images so big?]]

There might be more secure operating systems, such as [http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened_Gentoo Hardenend] [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/ Genntoo], but in adrelanos' opinion mortal users are unlikely to learn how to use them. More paranoids (and others) are welcome to use them for example as host operating system and leave feedback.

OpenBSD is recommended against, because it completely falls through the Whonix threat model, see FAQ entry: [[FAQ#Why_aren.27t_you_using_OpenBSD.2C_it.27s_the_most_secure_OS_ever.21.21.211.21|Why aren't you using OpenBSD, it's the most secure OS ever!!!1!]]

FreeBSD and OpenWRT have their own FAQ entries you could look into.

* FreeBSD: [[FAQ#Why_don.27t_you_use_FreeBSD.2C_which_is_more_secure.3F.21.3F]]
* OpenWRT: [[FAQ#Why_don.27t_you_use_OpenWRT.2C_which_is_more_secure.3F.21.3F]]

Ubuntu isn't used as Whonix-Gateway/Workstation operating system for legal reasons (see below) and was lately negatively perceived due to {{Code2|privacy issues}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/privacy-ubuntu-1210-amazon-ads-and-data-leaks Privacy in Ubuntu 12.10: Amazon Ads and Data Leaks]&lt;/ref&gt;, so it's recommended against to use it as host operating system as well.

Mac OS X can not be used for legal reasons. Even if that were not a problem, it's still a proprietary, closed source operating system, I don't like their attitude and how they (not) communicate with the security community. Also also see: [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/apple-took-3-years-to-fix-finfisher-trojan-hole/ Apple Took 3+ Years to Fix FinFisher Trojan Hole].

[http://alpinelinux.org/ Alpine Linux] on first sight appears to have interesting security features. But they [http://bugs.alpinelinux.org/issues/1067 don't package Tor yet]. Other than that, we didn't look thoroughly into it.

Fedora yet did '''not''' fall through Whonix's threat model and could be considered as host and future or alternative Whonix-Gateway/Workstation operating system. Also Qubes OS, an operating system focusing on security by isolation, is based on Fedora. Started considering it, help welcome, see [[Dev/Fedora]].

Qubes OS as host operating system would be most interesting. It just needs someone sufficiently motivated to do a little work to make it reality, see blog post [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/featureblog/2013/02/running-whonix-on-top-of-qubes-os-anyone-interested-unpacking-ova-images/ Running Whonix on top of Qubes OS, anyone interested?].

== Switch from Ubuntu to Debian ==
Beginning from 0.4.4, ''Whonix Example Implementation'' is based on Debian. Previously it was based on Ubuntu. From technical view, Ubuntu was a good choice, see [[Ubuntu#About_Ubuntu|About Ubuntu]] if you are interested.

The switch was due to Ubuntu Trademark issues, see [http://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/trademarkpolicy About Ubuntu Trademark]. The terms are long and complicated. Since Whonix's changes are beyond a ''remix'' (as defined by Ubuntu Licensing), Whonix would either to have to ask for a license, which they reserve to revoke. Such a legally insecure state is not acceptable. Or Whonix would have to rebrand Ubuntu. It would be possible in theory, but in practice it would require a lot work to remove all Ubuntu strings. [https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2012-September/263760.html Even new apt mirrors would be required], which is much beyond the manpower of the Whonix project.

Debian is much more free. According to Debian project leader Stefano Zacchiroli (in private mail), there are no trademark issues as long as the derivative does not claim to be Debian. That is easy to fulfill.

Derivatives of Debian are even encouraged to use Debian infrastructure, see [http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Guidelines Derivatives/Guidelines]. Debian even supports derivatives. There is a lot documentation, see [http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives Derivatives] and even a [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/ debian-derivatives mailing list].

== About Debian ==
=== General ===
Whonix is based on Debian. To be specific, as in Whonix 7, Debian testing is used as codename in ''/etc/apt/sources.list'', not stable.

Although the [http://www.debian.org/security/faq Debian security FAQ] states, that stable gets more attention from the security team, Debian Testing can't be so bad either, since many distributions are based on Debian testing and/or even Debian sid (unstable).

[http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html checksec.sh] --kernel reports good kernel protection: GCC stack protector support, Enforce read-only kernel data, Restrict /dev/mem and /dev/kmem access are all enabled.

Related:

* [http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census/Whonix Derivatives Census Whonix]
* [[Dev/Relationship With Upstream]]

=== Why was Whonix 7 based on Debian Testing, not Debian Stable? ===

* Contains [http://packages.debian.org/python-stem python-stem], which is a Tor controller library. It is in use to ask for Tor's bootstrap status. This is required for whonixcheck (diagnosing connection issues) and [[Dev/TimeSync|TimeSync]] (TimeSync starts as soon as Tor is bootstrapped). See this [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/60 ticket] for more details. The alternative, uploading python-stem to Whonix's APT Repository isn't doable given Whonix's contributor size. (It would require keeping up with the original package and updating when they update. And implementing the feature, allowing builders to build Whonix from source code without touching Whonix's APT repository for [[Trust]] reasons would also have been more difficult.)
* Being based on stable and incorporating a few packages from testing is difficult, see this [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/60 ticket] for details.
* Contains build dependency [http://packages.debian.org/jessie/config-package-dev config-package-dev] &lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt; debhelper support. (We could probably build on stable and just get the config-package-dev &lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt; debhelper support elsewhere, but it's simpler just to require Debian testing as build operating system.
* Stable (Wheezy) contains only obfs2 (obfsproxy [http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/obfsproxy 0.1.4]), while Testing (Jessie) contains obfs3 (obfsproxy [http://packages.debian.org/jessie/obfsproxy 0.2.3]), and obfsproxy has been recently removed from torproject's apt repository.

=== Why is Whonix 8 based on Debian Stable, not Debian Testing? ===
* Sometimes severe bugs are introduced in Debian testing, such as the AppArmor [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=732578 bug], which prevented Tor from starting for everyone until a workaround was applied.
* Sometimes bugs are introduced which break Whonix's build script, such as [http://ml.grml.org/pipermail/grml/2014-January/011546.html this] bug related to mount, which breaks grml-debootstrap and therefore Whonix's build script or [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734794 this] kpartx bug.
* Often other disturbing bugs are introduced, such as the grub bug (not able to reproduce and report upstream yet), non-functional VirtualBox Guest Additions or [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=728399 issues] with shared folders.
* Sometimes packages get entirely removed from Debian testing, such as enigmail wasn't available for a while in Debian testing. This is confusing and constantly creating support requests.
* Too often, too many packages are upgraded (not just security fixes) (costs lots of time to keep up, bandwidth, system load).
* obfs3 (obfsproxy 0.2.3) is [http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/dists/stable/main/binary-i386/Packages available] again in torproject's repository.

=== Popularity Contest ===

The Debian ''popularity-contest'' package popcon is '''disabled''' Whonix.

[http://popcon.debian.org/README popcon readme] | [http://popcon.debian.org/FAQ popcon faq] | [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=popularity-contest popcon bugs] | [http://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/popcon-developers popularity contest mailing list] | [http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/popcon-developers/2012-October/002172.html popularity contest mailing list: Drop atime and ctime for privacy reasons possible?]

Some privacy considerations and reasons why it's disabled:

* The connection would obviously need to go over its own Tor circuit (stream isolation). At the moment popcon tries to go through http and if it fails (no internet connectivity) it goes into the mail queue. (sendmail) Sendmail probably works though TransPort, but I don't know if it can be torified for proper stream isolation.
* (From the popcon readme) &quot;''Each popularity-contest host is identified by a random 128bit uuid (MY_HOSTID in /etc/popularity-contest.conf).''&quot; - This would allow to enumerate a quite good guess about the amount number of Whonix users. I am not sure if sourceforge could already have an insight about that (due to Whonix News File downloads, see whonixcheck) or about any other negative implications.
* MY_HOSTID would probably get created at Whonix build time and all Whonix users would have the same MY_HOSTID, which would make it useless. A new MY_HOSTID would have to be created at first boot of Whonix.
* Popcon runs at a random day. Good.
* If the machine is powered on: it runs at 6:47, which is bad, because a local adversary (ISP or hotspot) could guess popcon runs over Tor which would likely be a Whonix user.
* If the machine is powered off at 6:47, it sends the report later, only if anachron is installed. It shouldn't run instantly after powering on, also for fingerprinting reasons. The time would have to be truly randomized.
* &lt;s&gt;The transmission is not encrypted, see [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=480860 popularity-contest should encrypt contents] and it's not planned to encrypt it. Malicious Tor exit relays could modify the transmission, but this is only a minor issue. Such malicious Tor exit relays could send fake transmissions on their own.&lt;/s&gt;
* It's questionable if and if yes, how long Debian will accept popularity contest transmissions from Tor exit relays. There is potential for electoral fraud.

For these reasons it's not a good idea to add popcon to Whonix. If you have suggestions or a different view, please get in contact.

If you want to be extra cautious and really authenticate a OpenPGP key in a stronger way than what standard HTTPS offers you, you could use the OpenPGP Web of Trust.

One of the inherent problems of standard HTTPS is that the trust we usually put on a website is defined by certificate authorities: a hierarchical and closed set of companies and governmental institutions approved by web browser vendors. This model of trust has long been criticized and proved several times to be vulnerable to attacks [[Warning|as explained on our warning page]].

We believe instead that users should be given the final say when trusting a website, and that designation of trust should be done on the basis of human interaction.

The OpenPGP [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust Web of Trust] is a decentralized trust model based on OpenPGP keys. Let's see that with an example.

''You're a friend of Alice and really trust her way of managing OpenPGP keys. You've validated Alice's key.''

''Furthermore, Alice met Bob in a conference, and signed Bob's key.''

This scenario creates a trust path from you to Bob's key that could allow you to validate it without having to depend on certificate authorities.

This trust model is not perfect either and requires both caution and intelligent supervision by users. The technical details of creating, managing and trusting OpenPGP keys are outside of the scope of this document.

We also acknowledge that not everybody might be able to create good trust path since it based on a network of direct human relationships and the knowledge of quite complex tools such as GnuPG.

== Bootstrapping OpenPGP keys from the web ==
What in case you want to totally stay anonymous or have no trust path to a OpenPGP key?

Some people just write an unencrypted mail to the recipient and ask them to send their public key. The recipient will most likely either send its public key or at least its fingerprint.

This works against passive attacks. An observer wouldn't know what they have been talking about in the following encrypted mails. This totally fails against active attacks. A man-in-the-middle could replace the recipient's key with its own malicious key. The sender would use the wrong key, the man-in-the-middle would decrypt the message, read it, and re-encrypt it with the legit key and forward it to the recipient. Neither sender nor recipient would ever find out that their messages are being read by an adversary. - This is the whole reason, why the trust model path and key signing is recommended in the first place.

As an alternative, some people also publish their OpenPGP fingerprint or their OpenPGP public key on their personal or other websites. This gets more secure, if the website is accessible over SSL (more when both server and client are using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security HSTS] [and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions DNSSEC]]) and/or as a hidden service with a .onion domain. Of course, this presupposes, that the visitor is aware what kind of transportation mechanism is provided. In this case, the adversary would have to break the SSL or onion encryption while someone wants to obtain the key or fingerprint or to compromise the server, which may take, depending on the adversary more resources. Note, that both, the public CA system of SSL and Tor hidden services have security issues, see [[SSL]] and [[Hidden_Services#Hidden_Services_Security]] for more information.

For such a model, it is best if the same website is accessible over both, http'''s''' and .onion and the user visits both sites and compares if the results match.

To further improve the situation the key holder can spread its fingerprint and/or OpenPGP key to other websites. Some key holders attach their OpenPGP fingerprint to their e-mail signature (a short attachment of any mail) and participate(d) various public mailing lists. It will be difficult for an adversary to spoof all those information. This only helps, if the one trying to obtain the key is either aware of that or researching that on their own initiative.

This is a very difficult topic. Should anything be outdated or incorrect, should you have suggestions for improvement, please notify.

Quoted from the [[Introduction]] page: &quot;''The more you know, the safer and the more anonymous you can be.''&quot; This is even more true here. If you research on your own, you can verify if the information on this page is (still) correct or if new developments changed the situation. With more knowledge you may be able to reach stronger anonymity.

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ATM registers serial numbers of bank notes, where and when given to whom. Often cameras watch the ATM's. Credit card number is very often tied to card holder data.

&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Bitcoin will be discussed in detail below.

&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Transaction history, i.e. which account number payed how much, at which point, to whom, is available to the payment processor, law enforcement, tax investigation and who knows to whom else.

&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Quoted from theymos, bitcointalk.org administrator&lt;ref&gt;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=241.0&lt;/ref&gt;: &quot;''The history of a coin is publicly available. Anyone can see the flow of BitCoins from address to address.''&quot;

= Footnotes =

&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; Cash codes are printed once bought and could contain a code tied down to the exact shop location, perhaps date and time. I don't know if that already happens. If so that would be non-anonymous if they also keep camera recordings and/or bought by non-anonymous means (ex: credit card). The country code is already encoded into the cash code of Paysafecard and Ukash. A country code and/or city code already decreases anonymity.

&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; Anonymous credit cards and gift cards are '''not''' anonymous if you need to leave your real name and/or address or if you can't buy them with cash. Footnote &lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; also applies.

&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; Appearance, clothes, name?, date, time, if using a car: license plate number, etc.

&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; If someone can remember your appearance this can not be considered strong anonymity.

= Using prepaid cards =

One can buy prepaid cards at a lot of newspaper stands, gas stations and supermarkets anonymously &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; using cash. In Germany there is a limit of 100 €/month due to the Gesetz über das Kreditwesen (Banking Act)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kredwg/__25i.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Outlets selling cash codes (paysafecard, Ukash etc.) close to you may be found with the &quot;Find sales outlets&quot; search on the website of the provider. In order to a guarantee a smooth and anonymous deployment of cash codes you should consider the following advices:

* Refrain from checking the cash codes before using them. Use the codes immediately. Due to restrictive security settings cash codes are blocked automatically if they are entered from more than one IP address.
* If your cash code got blocked automatically, you could try writing an email to the support of the provider. If you provide a copy of that cash code they may give you a new one which is unblocked.

&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Please see the comparison about for further comments on how anonymous it is.

Without proper precautions paying with Bitcoins is not anonymous. All transactions are saved in a publicly available &quot;eternal logfile&quot;. Researchers of the Darmstadt University of Technology have provided an analysis of Bitcoin's anonymity&lt;ref&gt;http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4746.en.html&lt;/ref&gt; on the Chaos Communication Congress 2011. Another analysis&lt;ref&gt;http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/584&lt;/ref&gt; was published by D. Ron und A. Shamir. They were able to identify the IP addresses of users and link the different Bitcoin addresses of an account. For an example informations about the Bitcoin usage of Wikileaks were published. Until March 2012 Wikileaks used 83 Bitcoin addresses and got 2605.25 BTC from supporters.

This is only a very short introduction into Bitcoin. It's highly recommended to learn about Bitcoin in general before attempting to use it anonymously. That could be done for example by reading Wikipedia, Bitcoin website, Bitcoin wiki, Bitcoin forum and maybe some news articles. Additionally to this page it is also recommended reading the sources of this website (at the bottom), especially the [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity Bitcoin wiki article about anonymity].

=== Clients ===

It is a real pity, that there is no Bitcoin client with graphical user interface in Debian package sources. [http://bitcoin.org/ The official Bitcoin client] however works inside Whonix-Workstation. Downloading and verifying the blockchain unfortunately takes a very long time.

To enable Stream Isolation in the official Bitcoin client (bitcoin-qt) the user can go to the settings in the client and in the Network tab set the Socks proxy to enabled, 192.168.0.10, port 9111, Socks Version 5. 

The nonofficial thin client [http://electrum.org/ Electrum.org] (not yet tested by adrelanos) however looks very well and appears to be well designed. It does not need to download/verify the blockchain.

'''TODO''': Add instructions to get those clients safely (gpg or from source).

=== eWallets ===

There are also webservices to manage your Bitcoins using Tor Browser. '''Be careful with Bitcoin webservices / ewallet!''' It happened in past that such a service (mybitcoin.com) got compromised&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribbleagency.com/?p=8133&lt;/ref&gt;, all Bitcoin were stolen. Use them only for small amounts you don't care much to loose.

For example Blockchain&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blockchain.info/wallet&lt;/ref&gt; and StrongCoin&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strongcoin.com/&lt;/ref&gt; are offering the administration of an anonymous eWallet on their web servers. Registration at StrongCoin just needs an email address. Access to the wallet is protected by the common combination of username and password. InstaWallet&lt;ref&gt;https://instawallet.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and EasyWallet.org&lt;ref&gt;https://easywallet.org/&lt;/ref&gt; are suited for the administration of smaller amounts. A registration is not necessary. Accessing your eWallet is only possible with a unique link which is generated once you enter InstaWallet's website. There is no password protection. Feel free to look for other services.

== Accepting Bitcoin as Payee ==

Receiving Bitcoin anonymously (strictly speaking, pseudonymous) as a payee alone is quite easy. Just install a Bitcoin client inside Whonix-Workstation (as described in the introduction chapter) and get a Bitcoin wallet up and running. Give the Bitcoin address to the people likely to give money to you, for example if you are running some sort of anonymous website and like people do donate to you, just publish the Bitcoin address.

The payer is responsible for its own anonymity on its own. Some organizations try to increase the privacy of the payer by giving each payer an extra Bitcoin payment address, I can't say if this will improve things much or obfuscate your income better. At least this&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/05/fbi-fears-bitcoin/&lt;/ref&gt; news source claims FBI said so. It's being discussed controversy. Anyway, the payer should feel responsible for itself when wanting to stay anonymously while paying.

Spending the received Bitcoin anonymously is a whole other story and covered in the following chapters.

== Founding a Bitcoin wallet ==

=== General ===

You can either mine Bitcoin or buy them. Both methods are quite difficult to do in a significant amount while staying anonymous.

=== Mining ===

Mining Bitcoin needs a lot of computation power and it is my understanding, that solo mining is next to impossible. You would have to join a mining pool (or to create your own). Even if you did, it takes quite some time and/or computation power which also means electricity costs. Mining Bitcoin is not a part of this guide, feel free to research that yourself. Any kind of mining software should be safe in Whonix-Workstation. If that mining software can be made working effectively in a virtual machine is a whole different question, the answer may be yes, but it could be difficult.

=== Buying ===

You can also fill your wallet by buying Bitcoin. At the top of this page is a comparison of different non-Bitcoin payment methods. Any of them could theoretically be used to buy Bitcoin from a Bitcoin market. Practically it will be impossible to buy Bitcoin as an anonymous untrusted person with a payment method which can be charged back, due to a significant risk of fraud. Those include (non exclusive list) credit cards and Paypal.

==== Bank Wire Transfer ====

Bank wire transfer can be used to buy Bitcoin, but it's difficult (Impossible? Legally forbidden everywhere?) to open an anonymous bank account.

==== Anonymous credit card, Prepaid Cash Cards ====

Anonymous credit card, Giftcard, Paysafecard, Ukash, etc. could be more anonymous, but be sure to read footnote &lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; (near the top, you notice when you read from the top to the bottom).

It will be difficult (not impossible) to find an exchange Paysafecard/Ukash for Bitcoin, because Paysafecard stated, that they don't want to be involved into Bitcoin and anonymity services. Also the fees are exorbitant. Search for &quot;paysafecard or ukash Bitcoin exchange&quot; or similar, if you are still interested.

Since the exchanges are not part of the Bitcoin network, you have to ensure that they are legitimate. (And don't take the money and don't send Bitcoin.) It may be safer if you send small amounts until you have enough to lower the risk.

==== Buying with Cash ====

You can buy Bitcoins by cash or send cash by land mail without bank transfer and without leaking name or address to the Bitcoin seller. Please not the comparison about these methods on the top of this page.

* You may use the website [https://localbitcoins.com/ LocalBitcoins.com] to search for contacts of Bitcoin seller near your location and buy Bitcoins via in-person meeting.
* [http://bitcoinsinberlin.com/ Bitcoins in Berlin] accept cash by snail mail or you can buy Bitcoins via in-person meeting in Germany. You have to add the QR code of your Bitcoin address to your cash deposit. This QR code you may create at the website [https://btc.to/ btc.to].
* You may use the IRC channel [http://bitcoin-otc.com/ #bitcoin-otc] in the Freenode network to contact a Bitcoin seller. Offers of sale you may find in the open order book. On IRC you may approach a prospective salesman and negotiate arbitrary methods for the money transfer. A [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#bitcoin-otc web interface] for the chat is available if you did not like an IRC client like XChat ([[Chat]] article). There is an option to [http://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/GPG_authentication register a pseudonym] (it is not mandatory, though) which needs an OpenPGP key. As a registered user you may earn reputation. Check the reputation of other users to avoid scam.
* Feel free to look for other services.

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;Thanks to [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/ JonDos] ([https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=31220#p31220 Permission]). The &quot;Buying with Cash&quot; chapter of the Whonix Money wiki page contains content from the [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/premium_jondo4.html JonDonym anonymous payment page].&lt;/font&gt;

=== Conclusion ===

While Bitcoin can be accepted anonymously as described above, founding an account anonymously is very difficult, since there are no perfectly anonymous methods to get money into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

By cross reading many forum posts in the Bitcoin forums it looks like many Bitcoin users do not care to be anonymous at all. Others like to be anonymous and use another strategy. They accept, that their payment method to buy Bitcoin, for example bank wire transfer is non-anonymous, but (try) to anonymize their Bitcoin afterwards. This is discussed in the next chapter.

Before using non-anonymous methods, especially bank wire transfer, to purchase Bitcoins, you should consider, that buying Bitcoins, which magically disappeared afterwards, may be alone suspicious enough. Bank statements are being kept long time. It may depend on your location, legislation, the amount of money and your personal threat model, if that is acceptable to you.

== Anonymzing existing Bitcoins ==

(a) One method to anonymize already existing Bitcoins could be to get them out of the Bitcoin eco system and to get them anonymously back into it afterwards. (Not implying that this is easier.) Of course, this only works if it does not matter to you if the existing Bitcoins can get linked to you personally.

(b) Since the methods to purchase Bitcoins with strong anonymity are limited, many people recommend to route them through many Bitcoin exchanges run by different parties. I can't make a statement on how secure that is. In summary various sources say, depends on the amount of money, if the exchange can be trusted, if the exchanges keeps logs, how many people are using the exchange and if you get back your own or different Bitcoins. The [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity Bitcoin wiki anonymity page] covers this topic better. You can find discussions about this topic in the Sources chapter on this page.

== Paying Bitcoin ==

This chapter assumes, that you successfully anonymously founded a Bitcoin wallet or that you successfully anonymized existing Bitcoins. Once that is done, not saying the previous steps are easy, not so much is to do. Connection security is already provided, thanks to Whonix-Workstation and Tor. You can anonymously (strictly speaking pseudonymous) send Bitcoin to any other Bitcoin address.

It's important, that you keep care not to de-anonymize yourself by re-using the same Bitcoin address to buy stuff, which can be linked to your person. If you plan on re-using the Bitcoin address to spend the remaining Bitcoins in that wallet, you should read (b) in chapter &quot;Anonymzing existing Bitcoins&quot; above.

== Withdrawing Bitcoin ==

This chapter assumes, the Bitcoins are already anonymized. Either because of anonymously Accepting Bitcoin as Payee (see chapter above) or because because existing Bitcoin were anonymized. (see chapter above)

Buying items and sending them to an address should be safe (assumption valid above) as long as the price isn't to high and doesn't create suspicion. Like always, I can't give you a guarantee, that this is true, but I don't know what I might oversee after reading a lot about this topic. The items you bought could be converted into cash, if you sell them. You have to be careful not to create suspicion as well.

Anonymously cashing out Bitcoin directly into cash looks very difficult. (Impossible, while preserving strong anonymity.) Even thought, Bitcoin can be made more anonymous, when you leave the Bitcoin ecosystem you are left to the conditions of the other payment methods. Have a look again at the top of this page for a comparison of various payment methods to recall their advantages and disadvantages. Cash by land mail (to an anonymous inbox) or meeting in person appears to be most anonymous, but is still far away from strong anonymity.

|description=Send anonymous E-Mails. Mixmaster over Tor. Tunnelling mixmaster through Tor. Connection Schema: user -&gt; Tor -&gt; mixmaster -&gt; recipient
}}

= Mixmaster =

== Introduction ==

Motivation behind this: &quot;''What if there where a bookmark pointing to mail.local (or something like that) where you can simply enter an e-mail address, from sender (optional), subject and text, click send and mail is on its way?''

''No sign-up/registration/smtp server required.''&quot;

Mixmaster&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixmaster_anonymous_remailer&lt;/ref&gt; is a Remailer. Please read the [[Remailer]] article first as introduction.

There are two ways of using the Mixmaster network. Using Mixmaster inside Whonix-Workstation is the recommended way but more difficult. Unfortunately, there is no nice graphical user interface for Mixmaster on Debian GNU/Linux. The other way is using a webinterface, which is documented in the [[Remailer]] article.

This is quite an unusual setup. At time of writing there where no references that ever anyone ever successfully used the mixmaster software to remail over Tor. Therefore it might make clear, that you are a Whonix user.

== Mixmaster inside Whonix-Workstation ==
A fresh list of Mixmaster nodes is required. You can either update using the ncurses interface or using the Debian method. Both are documented below.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo mixmaster-update --verbose &lt;/pre&gt;

Mails can be send by command line.

&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;mail text&quot; | mixmaster --verbose --to=email@recipient.org --copies=1 --chain=breaka&lt;/pre&gt;

Or instead of using echo text, you can also read the text from a file. This is handy, because you can (and should) use a spell checker and because you can (and should if applicable) encrypt the text beforehand.

&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;`cat maildraftfile`&quot; | mixmaster --verbose --to=email@recipient.org --copies=1 --chain=breaka&lt;/pre&gt;

Or if you want to add a subject. (Which you most likely don't want, because the subject can not be encrypted.)

&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;mail text&quot; | mixmaster --verbose --to=email@recipient.org --subject=&quot;mail subject&quot; --copies=1 --chain=breaka&lt;/pre&gt;

Takes a moment and shows.

&lt;pre&gt;Chain: breaka&lt;/pre&gt;

Done.

Note, that it can due to the nature of the remailer network take a long time until your mail arrives.

== Implementation Notes ==

For technical stuff, see [[Dev/Mixmaster]].

|description=Manually Updating Tor Browser in case Whonix's torbrowser updater is broken
}}

= Introduction =
The Pre Install Advice page contains a chapter [[Pre_Install_Advice#Tor_Browser_Bundle|recommending]] to learn the basics about torproject.org's TBB before starting with Whonix.

For example at time of writing the recommended way by The Tor Project to update TBB is still to rename your old folder (for example /home/user/tor-browser_en-US to something else) (or delete it) and to extract the newly downloaded version. You won't know about such glitches, if you don't know the basics, namely how to TBB on the host.

General questions like how verification of TBB works, what that's good for etc. are off topic here, since we have to unfortunately regard this as basic knowledge. Whonix isn't a standalone package in that sense and just has a small team while torproject.org has a much wider community and dedicated support staff. Again, you need to imagine you know nothing about Whonix and need to learn basics about TBB in the first place.

If you are experiencing an issue with Tor Browser in Whonix (for example, some page does not load), please check first if you experience the same issue with TBB on your host. If that is the case, Whonix isn't responsible for this error. If you care to see the bug fixed, you are advised to search torproject.org's [http://trac.torproject.org/ bug tracker] and to open a bug upstream if no one else reported the issue yet. When upstream (The Tor Project) fixes the issue, the issue will most likely also get fixed in Whonix.

Sometimes Whonix's Tor Browser Updater breaks, because torproject.org changes the way TBB can be downloaded/verified. Since Whonix's Tor Browser Updater is maintained by the Whonix team, The Tor Project is not responsible for it and it and therefore should be discussed in Whonix's User Help Forum or Whonix's Bug Tracker.

At time of writing, there were never any errors in Tor Browser (such as when a page doesn't load) caused by Whonix.

= How to find out latest Tor Browser version? =
Check https://blog.torproject.org.

= General information about Tor Browser in Whonix =
See [[Tor Browser]].

= Manually updating Tor Browser =
(1) Go to https://www.torproject.org/ and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/ and download the Tor Browser Bundle for Linux 32 bit. Store it in ''/home/user/''.

(2) Read https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and learn about gpg verification.

(3) Go to https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/signing-keys.html.en to get the gpg keys.

(4) Verify the Tor Browser Bundle download.

(5) Go into ''/home/user/'' with the file manger. (Dolphin)

(6) If you still have the old version of TBB opened (because you are probably reading this from the old TBB), close it. (copy the next steps to Kwrite if necessary)

(7) Rename your old TBB ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US'' to something else. 

(8) Extract the Tor Browser Bundle. Right click on the downloaded archive -&gt; extract -&gt; extract archive here.

(9) In case you downloaded another version than ''en-US'', rename the tor-browser_''lang'' folder to ''tor-browser_en-US''. This is important, because the paths are hardcoded.

(10) Done.

(11) To start Tor Browser, got to your ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US'' folder and double click ''start-tor-browser''. Or type in terminal.

&lt;pre&gt;
/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser
&lt;/pre&gt;

|description=Development notes for adding MAC address anonymization to Whonix.
}}

= Introduction =

I was trying to sketch a user interface for a MAC changer, fulfilling everything mentioned on https://tails.boum.org/todo/macchanger/

To understand the problem better myself and to make sure we are all talking about the same thing, I thought it may be a good idea to create an overview. Therefore I made a nice table, which is attached below.

There are so many different threat models and goals, I am not sure it gets too difficult for the average user. For supporting all use cases, the user interface would become giant, just for deciding on which MAC touse.

= use case overview =

public computer could be a library.

public network_C could be a free wifi hotspot in a mall.

public network_A, public network_B, public network_D and public network_E could be different coffee houses with free wifi.

|}

Legend:

* Consistent mac: always the same after choosing one. Not showing up with a new mac each time.
* [https://github.com/EtiennePerot/macchiato macchiato]
* macchiato mac random: popular vendor id, latter part varies every time
* macchiato mac_D (or E): popular vendor id, latter part was random when the mac address was first created, after creating macchiato mac_D always get macchiato mac_D when choosing macchiato mac_D

= Or in words... =

# &quot;I am using my home computer, give me a macchiato mac random. I don't really need it, just give it to me. Feel so much better. Just in case.&quot;
# &quot;I am using a public computer, don't change the mac. Otherwise this might bring unwanted admin attention or the network simply gets unaccessible.&quot;
# &quot;I am using public network_A. I always used my real mac in past. The admin knows everyone and gets suspicious if someone changes its mac. Stick to my real mac.&quot;
# &quot;I am in public network_B again, I previously used macchanger to get the random mac_B. The admin looks if I am sticking to that mac, but doesn't know, that the vendor id doesn't even exist. Stick to the old random mac_B.&quot;
# &quot;I am using public network C for the first time. There are many users. I think the admin logs all mac addresses. I also think the admin knows about unpopular vendor ids and gnu macchanger. It's a popular network. The admin however won't remember me or anyone else. Give me a random mac from with a popular vendor id (macchiato).&quot;
# &quot;I am using public network D for the first time. I think the admin logs mac addresses. I also think the admin looks for unpopular mac addresses and knows gnu macchanger. The admin also get suspicious if someone changes its mac. Give me a random mac with a popular vendor id, call it mac_D and re-use it when I next time visit this network.&quot;
# &quot;Yes, network_E has very similarities with network_D. I think the admin logs mac addresses. I also think the admin looks for unpopular mac addresses and knows gnu macchanger. The admin also get suspicious if someone changes its mac. Give me a random mac with a popular vendor id, call it mac_E and re-use it when I next time visit this network. Don't confuse it with other mac's&quot;

= Thoughts =

Supporting use cases 6 and 7 would either require persistence or the user would have to remember or write down the mac address, which is difficult.

An ideal solution doesn't require persistence.

The user enters a word and using that word will result in creating the same macchiato mac_D or macchiato mac_E.

= Logging in to captive portals =
== When Using VMs ==
Many publicly accessible Internet connections (usually available through a wireless network connection) require its users to register and login in order to get access to the Internet. This include both free and paid for services that may be found at Internet cafes, libraries, airports, hotels, universities etc. Normally in these situations, a so called ''captive portal'' intercepts any website request made and redirects the web browser to a login page. None of that works inside Whonix-Workstation, so a browser with unrestricted network access is necessary. The browser on the host operating system must be used for this purpose. Note that this means that '''the browser on the host is NOT anonymous''', so use it carefully.

== When Using Physical Isolation ==

As in Whonix 0.5.6, there is no unsafe browser on Whonix-Gateway. This is subject to change for next Whonix version.

In meanwhile you could use a third machine, which has access to clearnet or boot the hardware which runs Whonix-Gateway with another operating system (from USB), which isn't torified.

== Security recommendations ==

* While this browser can be used unrestrictively for anything, it is ''highly'' recommended to only use it for the purpose stated above, i.e. to access and login on captive portals.
* Do not run this browser at the same time as the normal, anonymous web browser. This makes it easy to not mistake one browser for the other, which could have catastrophic consequences for your anonymity.

|description=Testing for IP/DNS Leaks OLD - automated script now available!
}}

= OLD =

'''Old instructions for copy and paste. This is available now as a script, see [[Dev/Leak Tests]].'''

= Introduction =

This leak testing article was written by adrelanos and smarm for Whonix but it can be useful for other projects as well.

Discussion: “Leak testing” (as defined here), is the process of verifying that the Whonix-Gateway will not send unencrypted / “in the clear” network traffic. Only Tor traffic should be observed coming from the Whonix-Gateway.

= Leak through the Whonix-Gateway =

Due to misconfiguration of the Whonix-Gateway the Whonix-Gateway might forward traffic for Whonix-Workstation which goes not trough Tor. The following tests are designed to test for such behaviour.

== Step 0: restrict Tor outgoing ports while testing ==

Why we do this will be clarified in Step 5.

Open your {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
&lt;/pre&gt;

And uncomment.

&lt;pre&gt;
#+# #OptionalFeatureNr.6#
#+# See Whonix/LeakTests. Activate this while testing for leaks. (Step 0)
#+# Deactivate after you are done! (Important!) (Step 9)
ReachableDirAddresses*:80
ReachableORAddresses*:443
FascistFirewall 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

and restart Tor using '/etc/init.d/tor restart'

This has to be undone after you finished testing. You will be reminded at the end of this chapter.

== Step 1: Prepare the testing infrastructure ==

Three tools are used during testing:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapy Scapy]: To create network traffic for testing. It is also desirable that the network traffic used in testing does not expose you to possible violations of security! Thus Scapy offers fine grained control over the creation of traffic for use with testing. Functionality defined here can be formalized into [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_test “Unit Tests”] via [http://www.secdev.org/projects/UTscapy/ UTScapy].

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark Wireshark]: Used to sniff network traffic. Can be configured with fine grained [http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChCapCaptureFilterSection.html “Capture Filters”], which can filter the traffic reported and captured by wireshark while sniffing traffic.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29 Python]: Used to support Scapy and can be used to easily script Scapy tests.

Install &lt;code&gt;wireshark&lt;/code&gt; to the Whonix-Gateway:

&lt;pre&gt;apt-get install tshark&lt;/pre&gt;

Set capabilities to run wireshark with user privileges

&lt;pre&gt;sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/bin/dumpcap&lt;/pre&gt;

Install &lt;code&gt;scapy&lt;/code&gt; to the Whonix-Workstation:

&lt;pre&gt;apt-get install python-scapy&lt;/pre&gt;

(This automatically installs Python as a dependency of Scapy)

== Step 2: Verify Wireshark is installed and working ==

(Whonix-Gateway)

'''Warning''': It is unadvisable to run Wireshark as root. 'su user'

Starting &lt;code&gt;Wireshark&lt;/code&gt; without options will begin to capture packets on the first available interface:

&lt;pre&gt;tshark&lt;/pre&gt;

You should see packets begin to scroll down the screen. This indicates you are seeing normal network traffic (ARP, DHCP requests, Tor traffic, etc). This will give you some idea of what to look for when we test for “leaked” traffic below.

== Step 3: Verify Scapy is installed and working ==

(Whonix-Workstation)

Start Scapy with elevated privileges to allow both sending and receiving of packets:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo scapy&lt;/pre&gt;

This should present you with an interactive prompt:

&lt;pre&gt;Welcome to Scapy 2.1.0
&gt;;&gt;;&gt;;&lt;/pre&gt;

Other “WARNING” or “INFO” items that appear when you start Scapy, are most likely not going to effect your use of Scapy for this testing.

Type the &lt;code&gt;ls()&lt;/code&gt; command, to see an overview of the protocols supported by Scapy:

&lt;pre&gt;&gt;;&gt;;&gt;; ls()&lt;/pre&gt;

Type the &lt;code&gt;ls()&lt;/code&gt; command and pass it a protocol type, to see information supported by that protocol and its packet construction:

&lt;pre&gt;&gt;;&gt;;&gt;; ls(IP)&lt;/pre&gt;

Type the &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; command to end your interactive session with Scapy:

&lt;pre&gt;&gt;;&gt;;&gt;; exit()&lt;/pre&gt;

See more information at the official [http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc/usage.html# Scapy documentation].

== Step 4: Do a simple ping test ==

(Whonix-Workstation)

Since Scapy is scriptable via Python, we'll use Scapy from within a Python script for our testing. An example script that creates a simple ICMP ping to the Whonix-Gateway's &lt;code&gt;eth1&lt;/code&gt; interface:

&lt;pre&gt;nano simple_ping.py&lt;/pre&gt;

Paste this code and save.

&lt;pre&gt;
#! /usr/bin/env python

# Since it will be useful to know something about the script, for the later tests, the terms are defined here:
# (A discussion of Python language structure is beyond the scope of this document)

# [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv4
# [2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol
# [3] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_routing
# [4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping
# [5] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol#List_of_permitted_control_messages_.28incomplete_list.29
# [6] http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc/usage.html#send-and-receive-packets-sr
# [7] http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc/usage.html#stacking-layers

import sys
from scapy.all import*

# define the target gateway &amp; data payload
target # &quot;192.168.0.1&quot;
data # &quot;testing&quot;

# define packets
# These define two variables, that are set to the object types IP and ICMP respectively. These objects in Scapy define the protocol type for IP (default IPv4) [1] and ICMP [2] respectively. And will send packets on the wire of these types when used. 
ip # IP()
icmp # ICMP()

# define packet parameters
ip.dst # target

# IP packets are used for routing [3] between networks on the Internet. So, we assign the destination (**dst**) in the IP portion of the packet we're going to assemble and send out.
icmp.type # 8
icmp.code # 0

# Defines the type of ICMP message to send out. The **8 type** is a type defined as **echo request**, e.g. a simple ping [4]. See a list here of  various types of ICMP [5] messages here.

# The  sr1() [6] command will **send and receive network traffic, returning the 1st packet received**.
# The notation of **ip/icmp/data** is the notation for encapsulation of various instances of networking protocols [7]. Read it right to left: **data encapsulated inside an ICMP message and encapsulated inside an IP datagram**.
&lt;/pre&gt;

test_ping # sr1(ip/icmp/data)

&lt;pre&gt;
if isinstance(test_ping, types.NoneType):
        print &quot;No response&quot;
else:
# Prints a short report on the packet received (if any). 
        test_ping.summary()&lt;/pre&gt;

Which will report the first successful ping from &lt;code&gt;eth1&lt;/code&gt; on the Whonix-Gateway.

To test, simply:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo python simple_ping.py
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which will report with something similar to:

&lt;pre&gt;
Begin emission:
.....Finished to send 1 packets.
.*
Received 7 packets, got 1 answers, remaining 0 packets
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Step 5: Setting up a “non-Tor traffic” capture with Wireshark ==

(Whonix-Gateway)

The command:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo -u user tshark -i eth0 -S -f &quot;ip and src host 10.0.2.15 and not (port 80 or port 443 or port 9001 or port 9030 or ssh)&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

(if you are not using VirtualBox NAT, you have to change the IP to your eth0 ip address, to find out that address type 'ifconfig') (TODO: make the command independent from the IP, use eth0)

When started wireshark should show NO packet information on the screen, as opposed to above where we capture Everything. To verify it's working correctly (and logging something, as opposed to logging nothing), (open a second SSH session or learn 'screen') from your Whonix-Gateway attempt to ping google.com. This should show something similar to:

&lt;pre&gt;
5.115829 &lt;eth0 IP address&gt;; -&gt;; &lt;nearby Google mirror&gt;; ICMP 98 Echo (ping) request  id#0x1010,&lt;/pre&gt;

seq#1/256, ttl#64 5.184410 &lt;eth0 IP address&gt; -&gt;; &lt;DNS server&gt; DNS 86 Standard query PTR &lt;some reverse IP&gt; .in-addr.arpa

Where the IP and DNS names have been redacted to protect the innocent.

Leave this capture running for subsequent tests.

'''Discussion''':

(See the [http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html tshark manual page] for more information)

'''-S''': Decode and display packets even while writing raw packet data using the -w option.

'''-i''': Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet capture.

'''-f''': Set the capture filter expression.

The “capture expression” (the bit in quotes above, after the '-f') reads: IP packets and from host 10.0.2.15 (your '''eth0 IP''' address) where the ports are NOT 80, 443, 9901 or 9030 ([https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorFAQ#DoIhavetoopenalltheseoutboundportsonmyfirewall common ports for Tor, see the FAQ]). The “ssh” keyword on the end is a predefined primitive in wireshark, used to define SSH traffic only. Adding this should not effect your capture if you are not using SSH to connect to the gateway, but should save you quite a bit of trouble filtering out your SSH traffic if you are.

See the [http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChCapCaptureFilterSection.html documentation for the format of the “capture filter” here], for more information.

(Note: This may not cover all valid TOR traffic emiting from your Whonix, some Tor nodes may use non-standard ports and was observed during testing. The FAQ above, also covers this.)

== Step 6: Scapy traffic testing: IP packets ==

(Whonix-Workstation)

Other testing is in the same vein as our ping (above).

'''First''': We'll test IP datagrams of all types to see if any are emitted:

&lt;pre&gt;nano exhaustive_ip_send.py&lt;/pre&gt;

Paste this code and save.

&lt;pre&gt;
#! /usr/bin/env python

import sys
from scapy.all import*

#define the target gateway &amp; data payload
target # &quot;google.com&quot;
data # &quot;testing&quot;

#define packet
ip # IP()

#define packet parameters
ip.dst # target

#loop through all IP packet types
for ip_type in range(0,255):
        ip.proto # ip_type
        send(ip/data)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run

&lt;pre&gt;sudo python exhaustive_ip_send.py&lt;/pre&gt;

On Whonix-Gateway you should see NO output from Wireshark. Otherwise you may have discovered a leak. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Packet_structure Documentation on IP packet structure] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IP_protocol_numbers IP Protocol numbers].

== Step 7: Scapy traffic testing: TCP packets and ports ==

(Whonix-Workstation)

'''Second''': We'll test TCP packets across all ports: (Note: This may appear as an '''ATTACK''' from some conservative ISP's / sites, use with caution. Google fields many of these types of scan's per day, so testing like this is most likely lost in the noise)

&lt;pre&gt;nano tcp_test.py&lt;/pre&gt;

Paste this code and safe.

&lt;pre&gt;
#! /usr/bin/env python

import sys
from scapy.all import*

#define the target gateway &amp; data payload
target # &quot;google.com&quot;
data # &quot;testing&quot;

#define packets
ip # IP()
tcp # TCP()

#define packet parameters
ip.dst # target

#loop through all TCP ports
for tcp_port in range(0,65535):
        tcp.dport # tcp_port
        send(ip/tcp/data)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run

&lt;pre&gt;sudo python tcp_test.py&lt;/pre&gt;

Again Whonix-Gateway should report NO activity, otherwise we've found a leak [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers TCP / UDP port number documentation].

== Step 8: Scapy traffic testing: UDP packets and ports ==

(Whonix-Workstation)

'''Third''': We'll test UDP packets across all ports:

(Note: This may also be construed as an attack, Google is a good target for this, just as with the TCP test)

&lt;pre&gt;nano udp_test.py&lt;/pre&gt;

Paste this code and safe.

&lt;pre&gt;
#! /usr/bin/env python

import sys
from scapy.all import*

#define the target gateway &amp; data payload
target # &quot;google.com&quot;
data # &quot;testing&quot;

#define packets
ip # IP()
udp # UDP()

#define packet parameters
ip.dst # target

#loop through all TCP ports
for udp_port in range(0,65535):
        udp.dport # udp_port
        send(ip/udp/data)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run

&lt;pre&gt;sudo python udp_test.py&lt;/pre&gt;

Again, check for leaks. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers TCP / UDP port number documentation].

== Step 9: undo Step 0 ==

Undo Step 0 now!

|description=Testing for IP/DNS Leaks
}}

= Introduction =

In past Whonix documentation stated &quot;in your own interest you should do the leak tests&quot;. That was from a time, where Whonix was only useful for very advanced end users, because only textual instructions existed; there were no scripts, no source code and the Whonix concept was brand new. It is unrealistic, that all download users do and understand the leak tests. That's why it was removed from the Readme.

You are still invited and encouraged to do the leak tests, in fact, at the moment, there are probably not many people auditing Whonix security.

Unfortunately, leak testing is as complicated as programming. You can not learn it overnight and you won't find someone online, willing to teach you for free. That's really something you have to do on your own. We continue to list and document all leak tests we are aware of, but we can not educate everyone in the depths of networking.

= Knowledge assumed =

* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/build/BuildSignoff#Expectedissueswithpopulartestpages Expected issues with popular test pages]
* Search for previous discussions before reporting.

= Leak Testing Websites =

There are too many websites for leak testing. (Some are offline.)

* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/build/BuildSignoff#TestPagestoUse List 1]
* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Testing/Tools#Sites List 2]

None of the Leak Testing Websites was able to find out the IP of Whonix-Workstation, no matter if plugins, flash and/or java was activated.

= DNS Leak Tests =

== Online ==

* http://www.dnsleaktest.com/
* Also check out http://check2ip.com/

== Defunct host DNS ==

Rendering the DNS on your host defunct should result in your not being be able to nslookup anymore, but Whonix-Workstation's DNS should still be functional.

== Defunct /etc/resolv.conf ==

On the Whonix-Gateway execute 'sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf' and comment out everything (# before every line so everything is ignored).

&lt;pre&gt;#nameserver 127.0.0.1&lt;/pre&gt;

As a test's result the DNS requests in the Whonix-Workstation should still work while the DNS requests in the Whonix-Gateway no longer work.

== Using dig ==

Another very poor manish leak test: Because Tor's DNS resolver does not handle AAAA records this will not return any google hostnames if run on Whonix-Workstation and DNS requests aren't leaking. Running.

&lt;pre&gt;dig AAAA check.torproject.org&lt;/pre&gt;

Should reply.

&lt;pre&gt;
; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.1-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; AAAA check.torproject.org
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOTIMP, id: 42383
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;check.torproject.org.          IN      AAAA

;; Query time: 0 msec
;; SERVER: 192.168.0.10#53(192.168.0.10)
;; WHEN: [date]
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 38
&lt;/pre&gt;

Tor also does not support DNSSEC yet. Running.

&lt;pre&gt;dig +dnssec check.torproject.org @localhost&lt;/pre&gt;

Should reply.

&lt;pre&gt;
; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.1-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; +dnssec check.torproject.org @localhost
;; global options: +cmd
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Using nslookup ==

Running.

&lt;pre&gt;nslookup -type=mx check.torproject.org&lt;/pre&gt;

Should reply.

&lt;pre&gt;
Server:         192.168.0.10
Address:        192.168.0.10#53

** server can't find check.torproject.org: NOTIMP
&lt;/pre&gt;

Running

&lt;pre&gt;nslookup -type=AAAA check.torproject.org&lt;/pre&gt;

Should reply.

&lt;pre&gt;
Server:         192.168.0.10
Address:        192.168.0.10#53

** server can't find check.torproject.org: NOTIMP
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Leaks through the host or VM =

Shut down the Whonix-Gateway and start the Whonix-Workstation. The Whonix-Workstation shouldn't be able to exchange data with any outside target.

= Ping Test =

First, make sure both VMs are online. Since ICMP is not supported by Tor and filtered by Whonix firewall, you should not be able to ping any servers.

= Integrated tshark leaktest =

The necessary scripts for leak testing are now integrated into the Whonix machines.

On Whonix-Gateway start looking for leaks.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Login as user, open a shell as user or su user.
## /usr/bin/leaktest
sudo leaktest
&lt;/pre&gt;

On Whonix-Workstation try to produce a leak.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Login as user, open a shell as user or su user.
## /usr/bin/leaktest
sudo leaktest
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are wondering, how this works and what that does, the old article, [[Dev/Leak Tests Old]] is still being kept.

* Original article.
* As copy and paste tutorial.
* For better understanding with more comments.
* Perhaps useful for similar projects.
* Optional additional tests.

= Integreated whonixcheck leaktest =
Please also run {{Code|[[whonixcheck]]}} on Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. It's Tor SocksPort and Tor TransPort test (the latter only on Whonix-Workstation &lt;ref&gt;Because Whonix-Gateway does not have a TransPort by default.&lt;/ref&gt;) are also doing leak testing. If {{Code|whonixcheck}} would report a big warning, if check.torproject.org couldn't detect Tor.

= Other Leak Tests =

A similar project published another leak test. Read [https://github.com/ra--/Tor-gateway/wiki/Faq How can I test if there is a leak in the setup respectively all traffic goes through Tor?]. Has not been tested with Whonix yet. If you do it, please share your results.

|description=How to change the User Interface Language for your Operating System and Tor Browser
}}

= Change the User Interface Language =
== Introduction ==
Because Whonix is nothing special and based on Debian GNU/Linux and KDE, you are free to change the system language. The technical steps are the same. You could also refer to Debian or KDE upstream documentation. If you are happy with the default English, you do not have to do anything.

== System ==
=== All Languages ===
'''Whonix-Workstation ONLY!'''

(1) Open konsole

&lt;pre&gt;
Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Terminal.
&lt;/pre&gt;

(2) Update the package lists.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
&lt;/pre&gt;

(3) Search for available language packs.

&lt;pre&gt;
apt-cache search kde-i18n
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or [http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=kde-l10n&amp;searchon=names&amp;suite=stable&amp;section=all search the Debian package archive].

(4) Install a language pack.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Example, replace the -ar with your language!
sudo apt-get install kde-l10n-ar
&lt;/pre&gt;

(5) Change setting in KDE.

&lt;pre&gt;
Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Locale -&gt; Languages -&gt; Change Language
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Russian ===

(1) Open konsole (terminal)

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
&lt;/pre&gt;

(2) You will see the list of enabled and available locales. You need to leave only two of them: the English and the Russian. They are as follows:

en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
ru_RU.UTF-8 UTF-8

Untick/disable all other locales if they are enabled, because if you have other Russian locales enabled you will get ??????? (questions) characters instead of the Russian letters while typing in the terminal/konsole.

(3) Reboot Whonix-Workstation for the made changes to take effect.

=== Korean ===
User contributed instructions originally posted in [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/fff34595/ Whonix Forum - Korean language support] by Anonymous. You can also use that thread for support questions.

(1) Open konsole

&lt;pre&gt;
Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Terminal.
&lt;/pre&gt;

(2) Update the package list.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
&lt;/pre&gt;

(3) View available language packs.

&lt;pre&gt;
apt-cache search kde-i18n
&lt;/pre&gt;

(4) Install Korean language pack.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install kde-l10n-ko
&lt;/pre&gt;

(5) Install Korean fonts.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install ttf-unfonts-core ttf-unfont-extra
&lt;/pre&gt;

(6) Open system settings and set eungulim as kde's font.

(7) Open konsole and

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
&lt;/pre&gt;

(8) Set &quot;''ko KR.UTF-8 UTF-8''&quot; as Default locale.

(9) Install nabi.

&lt;pre&gt;
apt-get install nabi
&lt;/pre&gt;

(10) Restart your Whonix-Workstation and start nabi.

(11) Done. You can write and read Korean now.

|description=How to change the Keyboard Layout in Whonix.
}}

= Terminal =
To change the '''keyboard layout''' in Whonix-Gateway:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-data

## French keyboards:
## Perhaps an upstream bug.
## ( http://free.nchc.org.tw/clonezilla-live/stable/Known-issues-Clonezilla-live.txt )
## If you are using French Keymap, Remember to use &quot;Select keymap from full list&quot;
## 1. Select keymap from full list
## 2. pc / azerty / French / Same as X11 (latin 9) /Standard

## Does not work in Debian for some reason.
#sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Desktop Environment (KDE) =

If you want to change the '''keyboard layout''' from the default &quot;us&quot; to something else:

&lt;code&gt;
KDE -&gt; Start menu button -&gt; Applications -&gt; Settings -&gt; System Settings -&gt; input devices -&gt; layout -&gt; add yours and remove default one -&gt; apply -&gt; Done.
&lt;/code&gt;

Or:

&lt;code&gt;
Start menu button -&gt; search -&gt; keyboard -&gt; layout -&gt; add yours and remove default one
&lt;/code&gt;

|description=Introduction into Whonix's Documentation
}}

Whonix in default settings provides more security than Tor alone. Anonymity is a complex problem and there is no easy solution to a set of complex problems. The more you know, the safer and more anonymous you can be. Whonix provides loads of documentation for those interested.

Anonymity isn't a program or setup, it's a process; new knowledge is being gathered constantly.

The goal of this documentation is to present The Whonix Anonymous Operating System in an easy to understand and reasonably thorough manner in the hope of giving new users a crash course in what might be a completely new set of applications and concepts regarding anonymity and security on the Internet.

It will '''not''' fully document the applications included in Whonix, but rather give an overview of them and go on to detail only Whonix-specific configuration considerations.

It is quite long so you might want to instead read the [[Warning]], [[DoNot]], and [[Download]] sections as well as the [[Documentation]] section as a reference only for those features you intend to use.

Whonix hopes to offer the technological means to stay anonymous on the Internet. However, we want to emphasize that staying anonymous is not only a technological problem – there is no tool, including Whonix and Tor, that will magically make you anonymous on the Internet. You may have to change your behavior as well. While deep technical knowledge of the architecture of the Internet, cryptology, traffic analysis techniques, and the applications you use certainly can help (mainly by knowing what not to do), we believe that some basic knowledge and good old-fashioned common sense and caution will be enough in most cases.

Introduction chapters should be read. Let's suppose you are interested in &quot;''i2p over Tor''&quot;. In that case, the introduction topic in &quot;''Accessing Other Anonymizing Services over Tor''&quot; should be read as well, obviously supplemented by the &quot;''i2p''&quot; chapter.

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;Small text&lt;/font&gt; and footnotes like &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; are not that crucial. They contain clarifications, sources of information, extra information for people with even higher security needs, information to clear doubt (in the case of controversial issues), proof of something, references, links, etc. You don't have to necessarily read all links behind footnotes. It's not that bad if you don't understand it as a beginner. We'd be happy if you are that interested and read it as well.

|description=List of Third Party Hosting Services that allow content to be hosted anonymously
}}

= Introduction =

You can either host your own anonymous services (web sites etc.) at home, at servers you physically own or you can use (free) services (free .onion web space, VPS servers, web space, etc.) provided by third parties.

For hosting your own services at home or at servers you physically own, see [[Hidden Services]].

This page is about Third Party Hosting Services. You can also host [[Hidden Services]] on some Third Party Hosting Services.

{{Header}}

= Third Party Hosting Services =

There are many so called offshore or anonymous hosting companies. Most of those hosting companies do not really offer anonymity. Most require valid registration data (real name etc.), forbid registration over Tor and/or do not offer anonymous payment methods.

The ones listed in the following list are Tor user friendly, accept anonymous registration and can be payed anonymously by BTC or prepaid cards.

If you like to be added to this list or have improvements or corrections, please get in [[Contact]].

|description=Hosting a (private) (obfuscated) bridge or (exit) relay using Whonix
}}

= Hosting a (private) (obfuscated) bridge or (exit) relay =

== Introduction ==

You can still volunteer to Tor and host a bridge, private bridge, obfuscated bridge, private obfuscated bridge, middle node or exit relay when you are using Whonix. Either inside the Whonix-Gateway or directly on the host.

== Inside the Whonix-Gateway ==
This chapter hasn't been tested for a long time. Get in contact if you are interested in this configuration.

Simply follow all the usual instructions given on torproject.org inside the Whonix-Gateway just as you would, if Tor wouldn't run inside a virtual machine. The only additional thing to do is to set up a port forwarding from the host to the virtual machine. That is simple. It's a VirtualBox feature. You can also do this with the VirtualBox graphical user interface. Go to Whonix-Gateway -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network Interface -&gt; Port Forwarding.

What's left are the firewall rules. On the Whonix-Gateway lookg at {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall/30_default}} and look out for.

&lt;pre&gt;GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMMING_SSH=0&lt;/pre&gt;

And change that to

&lt;pre&gt;GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMMING_SSH=1&lt;/pre&gt;

Scroll down to

&lt;pre&gt;
if [ &quot;$GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMMING_SSH&quot; = &quot;1&quot; ]; then
    iptables -A INPUT -i &quot;$EXT_IF&quot; -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
fi
&lt;/pre&gt;

and add

&lt;pre&gt;
# Tor
iptables -A INPUT -i $EXT_IF -p tcp --dport YOURPORT -j ACCEPT
&lt;/pre&gt;

|description=Get more disk space. Grow harddrives of Whonix Virtual Machine Images.
}}

In case you need more disk space on your virtual harddisk... Good news is, you are still a VirtualBox user. Whonix is nothing special. It's just another vm image. Any suggestions you find about VirtualBox will also work for Whonix.

Somewhat difficult, there is no easy upstream solution, such as a gui and because you have no *vdi* disk. You have a vmdk disk. &lt;ref&gt;Because *vmdk* is the standard for *ova* images (exported virtual appliances).&lt;/ref&gt; There is also no better (free, Open Source) virtualizer with this feature. However, you do not need to be a genius. If you build Whonix from source this is a easier. &lt;ref&gt;Search the file whonix_createvm for *VMNAME=&quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot;* and *VMSIZE=&quot;50G&quot;*. Increase *VMSIZE=&quot;50G&quot;* for example to *VMSIZE=&quot;100G&quot;*.&lt;/ref&gt; In case you are using the download version, it's a bit more difficult.

Unfortunately &lt;code&gt;vboxmanage modifyhd &lt;uuid|filename&gt; --resize &lt;size in mb&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not support vmdk images yet. (Perhaps that changes or has changed at your time of reading.)

(1) On the host: Make a clone of all states of your existing virtual machine in case something goes wrong.

(2) On the host: Delete all existing snapshots.

(3) On the host: Find the folder of your virtual hdd.

&lt;pre&gt;
vboxmange list hdds
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[Category:Documentation]]
(4) On the host: Switch that folder.

(5) On the host: Convert from *vmdk* to *vdi*.

&lt;pre&gt;
VBoxManage clonehd &quot;Whonix-Workstation-disk1.vmdk&quot; --format vdi &quot;Whonix-Workstation-disk1.vdi&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

(6) See the syntax.

&lt;pre&gt;
VBoxManage modifyhd
&lt;/pre&gt;

(7) On the host: Grow the disk.

&lt;pre&gt;
VBoxManage modifyhd &quot;Whonix-Workstation-disk1.vdi&quot; --resize 100000
&lt;/pre&gt;

(8) On the host: Go to VirtualBox VM settings, mass storage, remove the old .vmdk, add the new .vdi.

(9) Boot up and look if it's still working.

(10) Until now we have only grew the physical size, we haven't changed the filesystem. Shut down again.

(11) Inside VM: You have to boot from a boot cd (Ubuntu Precise *DVD* did work) and use some tool such as gparted to grow the filesystem. Start a terminal.

&lt;pre&gt;
gksudo gparted
&lt;/pre&gt;

(12) Inside VM: Grow filesystem. Apply and shut down.

(13) Done.

= Whonix-Gateway =

Whonix-Gateway MUST NOT be ever used for anything other than running Tor on it.

If this machine is compromised the identity (public IP), all destinations and all clear-text (and hidden service) communication over Tor is available to the attacker.

Our first goal in securing the Whonix-Gateway is minimizing its attack surface. By installing a &quot;minimal system&quot;, the only attack surface to an remote attack is Tor itself, apt-get and tails_htp. You can verify this with netstat.

Security features that do not prevent exploitation but only restrict what exploits can do, such as chrooting or sandboxing, do not make much sense: A compromise of Tor already results in a compromise of everything the user cares about.

Compile time hardening (see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5024 Bug #5024: compile time hardening of TBB (RELRO, canary, PIE)]) should be done by the Tor package maintainer and is beyond the scope of Whonix.

Debian is a good compromise of security and usability. More secure and hardened Linux or BSD based options do exist but they require too much work and/or maintenance to be considered for Whonix. The [[Dev/Operating System]] design page elaborates on that topic.

Having said this, you are welcome to use your own distro. The Whonix design is distro agnostic. You just won't be able to thoughtlessly copy and paste commands or to use the source without modifications.

There was also a Hardened Gentoo based Whonix-Gateway (unfinished, experts only! Needs maintainer). See [[HardenedGentooTG]].

|description=Freenet over Tor. Tunneling Freenet through Tor. Connection Schema: Tor -&gt; Freenet -&gt; Destination
}}

= Freenet =

== Introduction ==

There are different ways to connect to the Freenet network.

== Using a gateway (inproxy) inside your Whonix-Workstation ==

A [http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~md98-osa/gateway.html freenet gateway]. Still working? How to use?

== Freenet inside the Whonix-Workstation (Freenet over Tor) ==

In &quot;classical sense&quot; (directly and only over Tor) this is impossible. This is tested, freenet installs normally, but even with lowest security settings, connection will never be established. The problem is, that Tor does not support UDP. (There has been a [http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.network.freenet.support/8211 discussion] about this topic. Although it's from 2008, it doesn't look like, the situation has changed or will change.)

Workaround (tested): [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]]. Note that [[Security_Guide#Other_Anonymizing_Networks_over_Tor_UDP_Tunnel|Other Anonymizing Networks over Tor UDP Tunnel]] applies.

Another workaround: Buy, administrate and connect the SSH server anonymously though your Whonix-Workstation. Install freenet on the remote location and connect from your Whonix-Workstation (SSL or SSH tunnel). See the freenet wiki for more information.

|description=Development Notes for adding Flash Proxy (circumvention) support to Whonix.
}}

= Flash Proxy =

Credits: anonym on tails-dev wrote some things about Flash Proxy. These have been adapted for Whonix.

* Each flashproxy client requires a listening port on the open Internet. That's something we've never had in Whonix before, neither by default or through some options (our firewall even blocks it). That enables fingerprintability when scanning the ports of a Whonix host.
* Listening on a port like that also increases the attack surface dramatically; before this, no random host could try to attack Whonix by connecting to it -- the Whonix host had to (some how) connect to them first. So, yeah, these two things are quite contradictory.
* The above point also raises some practical issues: in order to listen on an Internet-exposed port, the user must either use IPv6 (which isn't served by all ISPs, and is unsupported/disabled by default in many routers in use) or, in the case of IPv4, set up port-forwarding (since most people are behind NAT). This limits the usefulness of flashproxy.
* The flashproxy client requires a direct connection to gmail.com, which I feel a bit uncomfortable with for a number of reasons. Currently Whonix only &quot;speaks Tor&quot; outwards, i.e. it communicates directly only with the Tor network or Tor bridges (exceptions: unsafe user on Whonix-Gateawy (e.g. for physical isolation users and captive portal login).

|description=Anonymous File Sharing using Whonix
}}

== Please limit! ==
Whonix will keep your IP address hidden while you use BitTorrent and other file sharing and P2P programs. However, because the Tor network suffers from limited bandwidth shared among many users, please be aware of how much you are downloading and uploading with these programs: A single 500 megabyte media file can equal hours of browsing for another user.

Violation of copyright laws risks harassment against exit nodes. To learn more about legal protections for file sharing in your country, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aspects_of_file_sharing

== The Tor Project ==

The Tor Project has yet to make a definite, official statement about the use of BitTorrent over the Tor network.

Quote [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-December/022376.html Jacob Appelbaum]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[...] I'm not clear that it will harm the network if Tails includes a BitTorrent client. I think that the harm comes when someone runs a few seeding boxes through Tor and doesn't bother to add any capacity to the network at all. [...]''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quote [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-December/022369.html Andrew Lewman says]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[...] There are completely legitimate uses of bittorrent over Tor. I've talked to people who want to get their ISO of Fedora or Ubuntu from outside their country, so they bt over tor to do so. [...] I'm fully aware that the tor codebase punishes me for doing large downloads over Tor, so be it. [...]''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quote: [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea Roger Dingledine]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[...] We've been saying for years not to run Bittorrent over Tor, because the Tor network [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow can't handle the load]; [...]''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

= Fedora =

Consideration for recommending Fedora as host operating system...

Website

* Looks much more friendly and modern.
* It's available over SSL.
* [https://fedoraproject.org/en/verify verification instructions] are also available over SSL.
* gpg signing key is available over SSL.

Package Manager

* yum is safe as apt according to the theupdateframework.com people

Consideration for using it as Virtual Machine Guest

(i.e. for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation)

* Is there a tool to create virtual machine images like there is grml-debootstrap for Debian?

Other stuff.

* Has not been considered yet.

|description=Technical Design Documentation about Entropy
}}
= Introduction =

Whonix 0.5.5 and above have haveged installed by default. (see below)

The [http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man4/random.4.html Linux Kernel man page] says: &quot;''[...] /dev/random should be suitable for uses that need very high quality randomness'' [...]&quot;.

Quoted from the [https://we.riseup.net/riseup+tech/entropy riseup.net page about entropy]: &quot;''[...] entropy-estimation is a black-art and not very well understood [...]''&quot;.

While it would be good to be cautions, i.e. learning about the entropy quality in Virtual Machines and if required learning about methods to improve it, it's not a critical problem. Successful entropy estimation attacks have never been reported for any software.

= Information resources =

* [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/11297 poor entropy performance]

== Software Packages ==

It has to be researched if they do work well inside Virtual Machines (VirtualBox). Simply installing all of them may not be wise.

=== haveged ===

Haveged is an entropy gathering daemon.

Quoted from the [http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/ais31.html haveged testing page]: &quot;''[...] will behave similarly in a virtual environment is a more risky proposition [...] there have been reports of VM that implement the processor time stamp counter as a constant and there are known differences in cpuid operation in others. [...]''&quot;

Will haveged create sufficient entropy in VirtualBox? Luckily, haveged comes with tools to check the if the entropy it creates.

The README in the haveged source folder and the [http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/index.html haveged website] contains [http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/ais31.html instructions] for testing haveged.

&lt;pre&gt;
apt-get source haveged
cd haveged-*
./configure --enable-nistest
make check

## perhaps repeat
#make clean
#make check
&lt;/pre&gt;

Should say something like

&lt;pre&gt;
0 failed individual tests
PASS: nist/test.sh
==================
All 2 tests passed
==================
&lt;/pre&gt;

This was tested in VirtualBox.

= Entropy Key =

[http://www.entropykey.co.uk/ Entropy Key]; Hardware not fully open source. Some resources say, it's okay as an additional source of entropy. Where to add it? Since Whonix depends on a host operating system, the Whonix-Gateway and the Whonix-Workstation, where it does make most sense to add it? Perhaps adding it to the host and using a entropy broker could be the most effective method. Better than buying three entropy keys.

|description=Preventing Tor over Tor for the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB), TorChat and others.
}}

= Why? =
See [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.]]

= Implementation =
Implemented in three ways on Whonix-Workstation.

* Implemented in Whonix source folder, {{Code|debian/control}}. The dummytor package uses the &quot;Provides: tor&quot; field&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;7.5 Virtual packages - Provides&quot; on http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html&lt;/ref&gt;, which should avoid any kinds of conflicts, in case upstream releases a higher version of Tor. This won't work for packages, which depend on an explicit version of Tor (such as TorChat).

* Tor autostart is disabled in {{Code|/etc/default/tor}}, so even if the {{Code|tor}} package gets installed, it won't be automatically started.

* rinetd listens on Tor's default ports. system Tor's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9050}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}} and TBB's {{Code|127.0.0.1:9150}}, {{Code|127.0.0.1:9051}}, which prevents the default Tor Browser Bundle or Tor package from The Tor Project to open listening ports on these ports, which will result in their Tor failing to open the listening port and therefore exiting, thus preventing Tor over Tor.

'''''DRAFT! UNFINISHED!'''''

= PIN Certificate Authority =

Weaker method (still better than no pinning at all), more easy to maintain.

Install required software:

&lt;pre&gt;apt-get install ca-certificates curl&lt;/pre&gt;

Download.

&lt;pre&gt;curl --verbose --tlsv1 --proto =https --capath /invalid/ --cacert /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/DigiCert_High_Assurance_EV_Root_CA.crt https://check.torproject.org&lt;/pre&gt;

= PIN Certificate Directly =

== curl method ==

Better method, more difficult to maintain.

Install required software:

&lt;pre&gt;apt-get install ca-certificates curl&lt;/pre&gt;

Download the public SSL certificate:

&lt;pre&gt;openssl s_client -connect torproject.org:443 -CAfile /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/DigiCert_Assured_ID_Root_CA.crt &gt;./x.cert &lt;/dev/null&lt;/pre&gt;

Or better:

&lt;pre&gt;echo -n | openssl s_client -connect torproject.org:443 -CAfile /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/DigiCert_Assured_ID_Root_CA.crt | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' &gt; ./torproject.pem&lt;/pre&gt;

Get SHA-1 fingerprint:

&lt;pre&gt;openssl x509 -noout -in torproject.pem -fingerprint -sha1&lt;/pre&gt;

Get SHA-256 fingerprint:

&lt;pre&gt;openssl x509 -noout -in torproject.pem -fingerprint -sha256&lt;/pre&gt;

Manually compare SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints with [https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#SSLcertfingerprint torproject.org FAQ: SSL].

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

Optionally render the ca-certificates useless for testing purposes. &lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;Using ''curl'' here, but ''wget'' has a bug [https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2012-07/msg00008.html Bug] and uses the ca-files anyway.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;sudo mv /usr/share/ca-certificates /usr/share/ca-certificates_&lt;/pre&gt;

Download with curl and the pinned certificate:

&lt;pre&gt;curl --cacert ./torproject.pem https://check.torproject.org/ &gt; check.html&lt;/pre&gt;

}}
{{Old-Stable-0.5.6}}
= Whonix News File Format =

'''Version 0.2''' used by Whonix 0.5.6

First line contains version and may not contain any spaces!

&lt;pre&gt;
0.3.0

news text here
some more news text
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

= How to create a valid Whonix News File =

== Manually ==

(1). safe as whonix_news

&lt;pre&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

(2). sign

&lt;pre&gt;gpg --clearsign whonix_news&lt;/pre&gt;

(3). test

&lt;pre&gt;gpg --verify whonix_news.asc&lt;/pre&gt;

== Using Maintainer Script ==

https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/upload_download_readme

= Extra implementation info =

Signing and verification (as sanity check) of [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/whonix_news whonix_news] is automated by [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/upload_whonix_news upload_whonix_news].

[https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/lib/whonix/whonixcheck/50_check-whonix-news 50_check-whonix-news] will find out the current installing version by:

&lt;pre&gt;
## Read only FIRST line.
read -r INSTALLED_WHONIX_VERSION &lt; /usr/local/share/whonix/version
## Remove ALL spaces.
INSTALLED_WHONIX_VERSION=&quot;${INSTALLED_WHONIX_VERSION//[[:space:]]}&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

While phrasing the whonix_news, it's not required to remove the OpenPGP Signature, because the function verify_whonix_news in [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/lib/whonix/whonixcheck/50_check-whonix-news 50_check-whonix-news] will use ''gpg --decrypt'' to get plain text, which will result in the Whonix News File Format.

= Changelog =

0.1 to 0.2

* /usr/share/whonix/version changed to /usr/local/share/whonix/version

== Introduction ==

While the project is small adrelanos thinks it's best not to make a too difficult policy.

== master ==

* &lt;s&gt;Adrelanos's progress of work.&lt;/s&gt;
* Not calling it unstable, because the changes will most likely never make it unstable but it's just not tested if it still builds.
* Branching model, project readme, information, gpg...

== stable ==

* last released and recommended Whonix version
* ready to include hotfixes

== development ==

* does currently not exist, since only one adding code
* candidate for next Whonix version
* &lt;s&gt;must always build&lt;/s&gt;
* currently restructuring
* we can make an always building development branch as soon as someone else commits code

== untested_adre ==

== untested_yourname ==

== perhaps 0.5.x etc. as release branches ==

== feature branches when it makes sense ==

== signed git tags ==

Releases will be tagged and gpg signed.

== temporary git tags ==

Will be named like: adretemp1 or 96adretemp

Can get deleted from time to time.

== Link to Source Code ==

|description=Development Notes about Bash Traps
}}

= Why trap ERR? =
Useful in functions. Would for example spot mistakes such as this one.

&lt;pre&gt;
if [ &quot;$manualrun&quot; = &quot;1&quot; ]; then
   ...
if [ &quot;$DAEMON&quot; = &quot;1&quot; ]; then
   ...
else
   ...
fi
&lt;/pre&gt;

Because the name of the function would be no longer available.

= INT TERM ERR =

Whonix (build) scripts currently &quot;trap INT TERM ERR&quot;. ERR is used stop the script (in most cases) and to inform where the error occurred. For cleanup, it would be better if EXIT where used other than trapping individual signals. There is no real limitation because of this, would just be more correct to have separate ERR and EXIT traps.

= Some extra old notes =

HUP (Hang up detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process) should be definitively added.

INT (Issued if the user sends an interrupt signal (Ctrl + C).) is in, because users of my build scripts are free to press Ctrl + C to interrupt them for whatever reason. What it does is informing about the last $BASH_COMMAND, cleaning up, dismounting an image (because not doing so and re-running the build script while the image is still mounted could lead to strange errors).

TERM (Software termination signal (sent by kill by default).) If one thinks &quot;build script takes to long, I forgot to add some files&quot; and uses kill to stop it, it's best to do the same cleanup as for INT.

ERR (Non-expected non-zero return code in rare cases (bugs).) Same information and cleanup as if INT or TERM.

SIGQUIT (Issued if the user sends a quit signal (Ctrl + D).) Well, I think Ctrl + C is more common than Ctrl + D. If one really wants this and stops my scripts this way, so be it. I think having one way to stop it while cleaning and one just exiting is good.

|description=Design Documentation about Redistribution of Whonix
}}

== Pre Building ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

Clean source code

* &lt;ref&gt;get rid of .directory files inside the source code: dolphin -&gt; preferences -&gt; general -&gt; behavior -&gt; use common view properties for all folders&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;ref&gt;get rid of ~backup files: {{Code|find ./ -name '*~' | xargs trash-put}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* You can get a list of unwanted files with {{Code|git clean -dfxn}} and remove them with {{Code|git clean -dfx}}.


* Use a newer snapshot.debian.org repository.


* Update Whonix debian package repository.


* update download readme
* add your own {{Code|default-key}} to your own {{Code|/home/user/.gnupg/gpg.conf}}


* push the source code to github

&lt;pre&gt;
git push origin master
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Create an OpenPGP signed git tag. This will also be used as Whonix version number.

&lt;pre&gt;
git tag -s version
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Push the OpenPGP signed git tag to github.

&lt;pre&gt;
git push origin version
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Activate building of qcow2 images. Set

&lt;pre&gt;
whonix_build_script_create_qcow2=&quot;1&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In ../buildconfig.d folder.

== Post Building ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

See [https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/tree/master/release Release Folder] in whonix-developer-meta-files source code.

* [[Dev/APT Repository]]

* OpenPGP sign the images.

&lt;pre&gt;
./release/sign_images
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Upload the images.

&lt;pre&gt;
./release/upload_images
&lt;/pre&gt;

* OpenPGP sign, verify, transfer sf download README.

&lt;pre&gt;
./release/upload_download_readme
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Update [[Download#Whonix_Version_Check_and_Whonix_News|{{Code|Whonix News Files}}]].
* OpenPGP sign, verify, transfer {{Code|Whonix News Files}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
./release/upload_whonix_news_v3
./release/upload_whonix_news_v4
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Testing ===

* At least a few testers should test final releases before posting a news. Testers may be found by posting a news.
* [[LeakTests]]!
* [[Test]] the images before final release! (Testers-only releases can be uploaded straight away.)

=== Wiki Page Updates ===

* Check, if [[Manually Updating Tor Browser]] is still up to date. (If not, fixing is task of coders, not release manager.)
* Update [[Download#Download_Whonix|Download Table]].
* Update [[Download#Known_bugs|Known Bugs]].
* See if [[Documentation]] still makes sense.
* Search the wiki for [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Stable]] and [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Testing]] and act accordingly. (Can also be done by coders, not release manager.)
* Update [[Physical Isolation]].
* Update links on the [[Build Documentation]] page.
* Update [[Features]].
* Update [http://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/ sf.net project page].
* Update default download on [http://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/ sf.net project page].
* Update [[Template:Version]].
* Update [[Template:WhonixFirewall]].
* Check version number on [[Main Page]] and check if it still makes sense.
* Incorporate new documentation which has been prepared on the page: [[Next]].

* create torrent downloads and magnet links

=== Announcement ===
* Finally announce: Post a news. (Not nagging external lists. Common sense. Mostly only final releases.)

|description=Development Notes about Network Manager
}}

= Network Manager =

It would be desirable to have a graphical network manager installed in Whonix-Workstation. There are a few main use cases. Changing Whonix-Workstation's internal IP address for [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]], setting up a post-Tor-VPN using a graphical user interface and other kinds of advanced network configurations over Tor which are simpler to set up using a grapical user interface.

At the moment networking still managed by the ordinary ifupdown way in /etc/network/interfaces.

If you want to install the KDE Network Manager.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install network-manager-kde&lt;/pre&gt;

Then it can be started from the Start Menu.

&lt;pre&gt;Start menu -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Network Settings&lt;/pre&gt;

You won't see Whonix's internal network interface right away. You could make it visible in Network Manger, by editing /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and setting managed to true.

&lt;pre&gt;
[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile

[ifupdown]
managed=true
&lt;/pre&gt;

That would be quite useful, if changing settings where possible. However, the NetworkManager.conf man page says, write support for ifupdown managed devices isn't planned.

The Fedora wiki has a nice page about [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Tools/NetworkManager Network Manager] which is useful for a distro packager perspective.

Quote: &quot;''NM is slowly changing from a desktop network connection configurator to a universal network configuration software that could be used as a part of the base system.''&quot;

Once NM can do everything ifupdown can do (i.e. suitable for all tasks also from command line), ifupdown in Whonix could get completely replaced with NM.

Since IPv6 support in NM is said to be not in a production state yet, I am hesitate to switch to NM. Tor recently added support for IPv6 bridges and full IPv6 support could come in future. If Tor fixes IPv6 support first, there would eventually still (again) need for ifupdown. Therefore I think at the moment it's best to let NM mature.

For running NM on Whonix-Gateway it would be required to check if the pre-up hook to start the firewall works flawless. Having a pre-up hook which fails closed like ifupdown currently provides is desirable, because when there is a tiny syntax error in the firewall, the network won't come up and nothing leaks. Alternatively, an init.d script could be developed, it would have to be researched, if it can provide the same fail closed protections.

Since many people are interested in post-Tor-VPNs (user -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN), it is open for debate if network-manager-kde should be pre-installed on Whonix-Workstation. Would the user be confused because it won't show the (virtual) wired internal network interface? Would it be less/more confusing if the (virtual) wired internal network interface where shown but impossible to edit? Shouldn't it be pre-installed for these confusion reasons and recommended to be installed manually for users interested in post-Tor-VPNs?

As a footnote, it's also possible to use Gnome applications in Whonix (KDE based), such as [[TestVPN#GNOME_Network_Manager|Gnome Network Manager chapter on TestVPN page]].

[https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=689339#c4 Quote]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;''Please also understand that currently networkmanager is not a security tool at all. VPN plugins are regarded as connectivity plugins, not security plugins.''&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Missing auto-reconnect feature: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=349151

So perhaps using NM to set up VPNs for security isn't a good idea.

Doesn't look like NM has a fail closed mechanism: [[VPN-Firewall]]

|description=Technical Design Documentation about Mixmaster
}}
= Mixmaster =

== Introduction ==

Motivation behind this: &quot;''What if there where a bookmark pointing to mail.local (or something like that) where you can simply enter an e-mail address, from sender (optional), subject and text, click send and mail is on its way?''

''No sign-up/registration/smtp server required. Could look like [https://www.awxcnx.de/mm-anon-email.htm this]. (Or [https://www.cotse.net/cgi-bin/mixmail.cgi this] or [https://webmixmaster.paranoici.org/mixemail-user.cgi this].)''&quot; ([https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-December/002384.html Development discussion])

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixmaster_anonymous_remailer Mixmaster] is a Remailer. Please read the [[Remailer]] article first as introduction.

There are two ways of using the Mixmaster network. Installing Mixmaster in Debian is the recommended way but more difficult. Unfortunately, there is no nice graphical user interface for the Mixmaster for Debian GNU/Linux. There are web interfaces at the bottom of this page, I don't know yet how to use them.

This is quite an unusual setup. At time of writing there where no references that ever anyone ever successfully used the mixmaster software to remail over Tor. Therefore it might make clear, that you are a Whonix user.

== Mixmaster inside Whonix-Workstation ==

=== Third Party Information ===

==== Tutorial Videos ====

There is a video without speech on Ubuntu, but steps on Debian are the same. No speech, but good video anyway.

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmIHcrrkj2w

There is also a video with speech explaining Mixmaster. Video comments:

* Before 4:38 min he explains general things about Mixmaster. I don't agree, for reasons explained above. The video is already four years old.
* Before 4:38 min he explains to manually install it. We don't have to do it, since it's available as Debian package.
* You could watch https://www.youtube.com/dzbrFPO4604 beginning from 4:38 min.

==== Documentation ====

debian-administration.org: [http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/483 Using mixmaster to send anonymous email] from 2006 written by Jacob Appelbaum. Still contains useful information. &lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;Even though */etc/mixmaster/remailer.conf* contains a *SENDMAIL* directive, a [http://www.plex86.org/linux2/Mixmaster-Tutorial-Third-Draft-Comments--This-message-did-not-originate-from-the-Sender-address-above.html Mixmaster Tutorial Third] says Postfix is Mixmaster default. This directive does not require changing.&lt;/font&gt;

=== Installing ===

==== Installation ====

===== Whonix-Gateway =====

{{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} contains.

&lt;pre&gt;
mapaddress 1.1.1.1 k54ids7luh523dbi.onion
mapaddress 2.2.2.2 gbhpq7eihle4btsn.onion
&lt;/pre&gt;

===== Whonix-Workstation =====

Has mixmaster installed by default.

/home/user/.Mix/mix.cfg contains.

&lt;pre&gt;
#SMTPRELAY      1.1.1.1
SMTPRELAY       2.2.2.2
&lt;/pre&gt;

/etc/hostname contains.

&lt;pre&gt;host&lt;/pre&gt;

/etc/hosts contains.

&lt;pre&gt;127.0.0.1 host.localdomain host&lt;/pre&gt;

This is because mixmaster leaks these information to the mixmaster node, it's better to have it uniform.

=== Configuration ===

A fresh list of Mixmaster nodes is required. You can either update using the ncurses interface or using the Debian method. Both are documented below.

==== ncurses method ====

In Terminal:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mixmaster

## Press keys:
# 1
u      for update
# 2
*      to begin update
# 3
k      worked for me 
# 4
q      for quit (no longer run it as root)
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Debian method ====

&lt;pre&gt;sudo mixmaster-update --verbose &lt;/pre&gt;

There is an exception in ''/etc/sudoers'' for mixmaster-update to allow running mixmaster-update without root.

=== Using ===

In Terminal:

&lt;pre&gt;mixmaster&lt;/pre&gt;

and use the text interface. Perhaps watch the video as explained above.

If you don't like the text interface you may use it by command line. If you want to read the manual.

&lt;pre&gt;man mixmaster&lt;/pre&gt;

Mails can also be send by command line. See documentation article [[Mixmaster]] for instructions how to use it.

=== Debugging ===

After sending when there is no error.

&lt;pre&gt;Chain: breaka&lt;/pre&gt;

Error example.

&lt;pre&gt;
Error: SMTP relay not ready. 
Error: SMTP relay not ready. 
Error: Unable to execute sendmail. Check path!
Error: SMTP relay not ready. 
Error: SMTP relay not ready. 
Error: Unable to execute sendmail. Check path!
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Webinterface ==

http://remailer.paranoici.org/scripts/webscripts.tar.gz

* Online demo looks good.
* GNUPL license needs clarification.

http://www.cotse.net/mixweb.tgz

* Online demo looks good.
* Unfree license. Only free for non-commercial use. Although there is a promise not to sue one, commercial users are required to buy a license.
* Therefore not suited as default in Whonix.

http://pyanon.sourceforge.net

* Looks great.
* Requires Apache 2 with mod_python.
* Therefore not suited as default in Whonix. (Users may want to use Apache for running a hidden service. Also quite big. Might be re-considered.)

== Development ==

Note: Mixmaster gets confused if there are # comments at the top of ''~/.Mix/mix.cfg''.

[[Stream Isolation]] as in forcing Mixmaster traffic through a separate SocksPort has not yet been figured out and help is welcome. Mixmaster traffic goes through Tor's TransPort. Since we are only connecting to Mixmaster relays, which provide a hidden service, identity correlation should be prevented. To make sure, asked [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-January/027116.html tor-talk: Are connections to two different hidden services stream isolated?].

Other ideas:

* Postfix has an option to skip MX lookups for a given hostname: look for &quot;square brackets&quot; in postconf(5).
* [http://www.groovy.net/ww/2011/12/torfix Using Postfix with Tor]
* [http://www.groovy.net/ww/2012/01/torfixbis Using Postfix with Tor (bis)]

The [[Deprecated]] page contains information related to Mixmaster: MX DNS requests, MX capable DNS resolver, using Postfix and debugging Postfix.

Will appear in Whonix {{Whonix6}} and above.

[http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&amp;m=136497689725852&amp;w=2 KDE Mailing list: How to learn about all those configuration file values?]

== kdedrc ==

https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/kde/share/config/kdedrc

&lt;pre&gt;## What does it do: Disable KDE Bluetooth integration
## Source: http://userbase.kde.org/Bluedevil
## Whonix: Not required in Whonix 
[Module-bluedevil]
autoload=false&lt;/pre&gt;
kcmshell4 --list | grep mount, gives me device_automounter_kcm, with a description: &quot;Configure automatic handling of removable storage media&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;kcmshell4 device_automounter_kcm give me... well you can try it.

Of course that's the Removable Device Automounter, as listed in the services configuration (kcmkded).

Without this module running the new removable device should still show up in device-notifier, but the configured automount actions won't occur.&lt;br /&gt;This one will strongly depend on whether the user is willing to jump thru manual hoops to mount a newly plugged removable storage device, or would prefer that kde handled it even at the expense of a bit of kde startup speed and memory for the automounting service. Of course people like me don't like kde mounting stuff behind their back anyway, so turning it off is an easy choice here, but a lot of users want the system to handle it... if they even know anything about mounting to begin with.

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&amp;m=136497689725852&amp;w=2

&lt;pre&gt;
[Module-device_automounter]
autoload=true
&lt;/pre&gt;

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&amp;m=136497689725852&amp;w=2

&lt;pre&gt;
[Module-dnssdwatcher]
autoload=false

## What does it do: This module notifies the user when /home or one of
## the other directories which you can configure it to monitor are
## running out of space. 
## Source: http://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/freespacenotifier
## Whonix: We should probably leave it enabled.
[Module-freespacenotifier]
autoload=true

[Module-kwrited]
autoload=false

[Module-nepomuksearchmodule]
autoload=false
&lt;/pre&gt;

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&amp;m=136497689725852&amp;w=2 I /think/ this is Network Status in kcmkded. But as I don't run network-manager or the like at all, instead using initscripts for my network management, I have absolutely no experience with this.

&lt;pre&gt;
[Module-networkmanagement]
autoload=false

[Module-obexftpdaemon]
autoload=false
&lt;/pre&gt;

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&amp;m=136497689725852&amp;w=2 kcmkded says display management change monitor. Probably useful for laptop users that often plug external monitors or who frequently change resolution, not so much for folks who always run the same monitor config and resolution.

&lt;pre&gt;
[Module-randrmonitor]
autoload=false
&lt;/pre&gt;

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde&amp;m=136497689725852&amp;w=2 Remote URL change notifier. For those with network folders this is probably useful. Otherwise, not so much.

= Desktop Icons =
[[File:Symlink.png]]

The arrows and italic font of the desktop icons is ugly.

They are arrows and italic font, because the desktop icons are symlinks.

Using symlinks has several advantages.
# prevents code duplication
# to prevent writing into the user's home folder &lt;ref&gt;Litian will complain when shipping files in /home/*.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Debian developers are strictly against writing into /home/. It's against Debian policy. Writing into /home/ reduces chances that Whonix gets some day merged into Debian (at least big parts of it). Getting big parts merged into Debian would be a major advantage.&lt;/ref&gt;
# being able to update for example /usr/share/applications/whonix/whonix-whonixcheck.desktop &lt;ref&gt;update as in: new icon, new description, translations, who knows...&lt;/ref&gt;
# the user is free to delete them and to prevent getting them re-added by blacklisting the responsible postinst.d script

There will be no arrows, if they are copies and chmod +x. Using copies is no real alternative due to the advantages listed above.

The real fix is an open question for research:

'''How to tell KDE to use no arrows and no italic font for symlinked desktop icons?'''

|description=Technical Design Documentation about JonDo
}}
= JonDo =

JonDo can already be used over Tor when it's installed inside Whonix-Workstation (user -&gt; Tor -&gt; JonDo), see [[JonDonym]].

Installing it by default.... I don't know. Only one person asked about JonDo... I am not very positive that JonDo will be pre-installed on Whonix-Workstation by default, although I am not totally against it.

All software in Whonix by default should be able to update itself (or at least inform that it's outdated so it can be updated with only one command, such as torbrowser). I don't know if their Debian repository works for Debian Wheezy, which Whonix is based on. Can you test it please?

I also wouldn't know what happens if they replace their signing key.

As Whonix developer I can't really support the JonDo software. I don't have time to build JonDo from source code and ship a new build of Whonix each time JonDo gets updated.

They have their own instructions in on their homepage and those may change over time. If follow their instructions and pre-install it and they change the instructions, Whonix users will still have the outdated versions. What should I do in that case? Post in important blog &quot;now follow these command line instructions and get JonDo updated if you use it&quot;?

So this almost always requires either to offload installing it to the user or some cooperation from the original software project.

Whonix is also [[FAQ#Does_Whonix_modify_Tor.3F|quite simple]] at the moment and I don't know how the project would be perceived if Tor Browser and JonDoFox were installed by default.

Building Whonix from source code, custom builds are always possible. To make this happen, it needs someone deeply caring about JonDo and contributing to Whonix. Otherwise it's very unlikely.

We will use Whonix.

Whonix is an '''anonymous'''

operating

system.

It is very important to know, that this video assumes, that you have already installed Whonix and booted into Whonix-Workstation.

If you still need to do that, there are other tutorial videos on that channel on how to download and install Whonix.

Open Tor Browser.

(Wait until check.torproject.org reports &quot;you are using Tor&quot;.)

Go to the Whonix homepage.

h t t p s : / / whonix . o r g

Look around.

Click on Flash Support.

Scroll down and read that page.

It is about possible alternative to Flash

And goes into details on what level of security and anonymity you are going to get.

It also contains tips on how to improve security and anonymity.

If you are really paranoid or have very high security needs, you shouldn't use Flash at all and stick to the alternatives.

However, we believe, that Whonix is currently your best bet to use Flash while protecting you from DNS leaks,

hiding your location and IP address.

Open a terminal.

Copy or type &quot;sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree&quot; and press enter.

For better privacy,

to delete Flash Cookies,

it is recommended to install a Firefox Add On called BetterPrivacy.

Right click on BetterPrivacy.

Choose

Open Link in a New Tab.

Click.

Check,

that there is a the padlock.

Check, that you are connected to h t t p '''s''' : // addons . mozilla . org

Click on Add to Firefox.

Click on Allow.

Click on Install Now.

Right click on Tor Button -&gt; Click on Preferences... -&gt; Click on Security Settings -&gt; Click uncheck, &quot;Disable Plugins during Tor usage&quot;.

We have to restart Tor Browser.

Close Tor Browser.

(''Wait a few seconds so it's really closed.'')

Restart Tor Browser.

(''Wait until check.torproject.org reports &quot;you are using Tor&quot;.'')

Let's test it.

Go to h t t p '''s''' : / / youtube . com

Let's click on some random video.

It's working.

(''Right click on Video to show it's really a Flash video. If not, click on some other random recommended video and right click on Video again until you got a Flash (not a html5) one.'')

That's it. Link to Whonix is inside the video description.

|description=Whonix Linux Desktop Tips and Tricks, RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter, Auto Login, Single vs Double Click, full-screen
}}
= Single vs Double Click =
KDE uses single click instead of double click by default. If you want to change that to double click:

&lt;code&gt;
KDE -&gt; Start menu button -&gt; Applications -&gt; Settings -&gt; System Settings -&gt;
input devices -&gt; mouse -&gt; double click -&gt; apply - Done.
&lt;/code&gt;

= Use full-screen =
It's advised to work in full-screen. This feature is also inherited from VirtualBox. Press your host key&lt;ref name=vboxhostkey&gt;VirtualBox -&gt; Global Settings -&gt; Input -&gt; Host Key. You can also see the current Host Key in the bottom right corner of VirtualBox.
&lt;/ref&gt; and press F. That will activate full-screen. You end up with Whonix (and Debian) default resolution and color depth 1024x768x24&lt;ref&gt;As per [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].&lt;/ref&gt;. To disable it the same key combination can be used.

= Virtual Consoles =
This feature is inherited from Debian GNU/Linux. It's noted here, because not many people are aware of it. The Debian (not Whonix) feature is to press {{Code2|alt + crtl + F1}} or F2, F3, etc. to get for additional text consoles or F7 for graphical console.

When being inside VirtualBox, the {{Code2|alt + ctrl}} keys are already registred by the host operating system.
Instead of alt + ctrl, you can use the VirtualBox Host Key&lt;ref name=vboxhostkey /&gt;. That means, use Host Key + F1, F2, F7, etc. to do the same inside VirtualBox.

= Shut down the Whonix-Gateway =

To '''shut down''' the gateway simply enter

&lt;pre&gt;sudo poweroff&lt;/pre&gt;

(Or use Start -&gt; Leave...)

= RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter =
[[File:RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter created by adrelanos.png|400px|thumb|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter won't start the desktop environment. You can use the terminal based version of Whonix-Gateway.]]
When booting up, you will be prompted and can always manually press ctrl + c to prevent KDE from starting.

By default, since Whonix {{Whonix6}}, Whonix-Gateway comes with 768 MB virtual RAM. This can be reduced on systems with low resources.

* If there is more than 512 MB RAM in total, the desktop environment (KDE by default) will be started.
* If less than 512 MB RAM in total (for example, only 128 MB RAM in total), KDE (kdm) will not be started.

This should be quite convenient, because users with low RAM could reduce (Whonix-Gateway) RAM to 128 MB and even if they sometimes wanted to configure/check something, they could assign 512 RAM and automagically boot into the graphical KDE desktop. There are also many settings in /etc/whonix.d/ to configure this feature, so if you want, you can also add a lot RAM, but not boot into a desktop environment, or use different display managers and so on.

= whonixcheck/timesync writing to tty1 =
[[File:writing to tty1 by adrelanos.png|400px|thumb|[[whonixcheck]] wrote its results to tty1]]
It's difficult to keep terminal users, i.e. for users who are not using a graphical desktop environment, posted with the status if their system. Therefore two applications coming with Whonix, timesync and whonixcheck, will do something unique, or at least very rare.

Even if you are logged into your terminal tty1 and see a command prompt, it can happen that you suddenly see status messages from whonixcheck or timesync. This can be nice for example once your Whonix-Gateway configured to your liking (if you needed to do that at all) and just want to get posted with status messages about your system. On the other hand, this can be disturbing, if you're currently doing something, like editing a configuration file and then suddenly status messages are written to your screen. In that case, it's advised to log into tty other than tty1, for example tty2.

* Default-Download-Version users can use the VirtualBox host key (right ctrl by default) and F2: right ctrl + F2
* Physical isolation users can use the standard feature, which comes with Debian: ctrl + ALT + F2

= Disable Auto Login =
TODO: To be written.

= Higher Screen Resolution without installing VirtualBox guest additions =
See [[Higher_Screen_Resolution|Higher Screen Resolution without installing VirtualBox guest additions]].

}}
{{forkme}}
= List of installed Packages =

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/Whonix-Workstation_packages

= Files =

== Essential ==

=== Network Configuration ===

Configure the system resolver to use the Gateway to resolve DNS. (There can be no DNS leaks, because the Gateway firewall prevents that.) It shouldn't get used often, only for applications which are not configured to use [[Stream Isolation]] (SocksPort). Just as a general catch all for user installed applications to improve usability.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/2500_create-vbox-vm in function workstation_specific, one virtual network card, type internal
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/resolv.conf.whonix
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/network/interfaces.whonix

=== DummyTor ===

Since the anonymizer software runs on the Gateway, users could still accidental install the anonymizer software on the Workstation. This would lead into connecting to the anonymity network over the anonymity network itself. In best case it just doesn't work or is very slow and in worst case it leads to unknown consequences. Prevent that.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Banning the Tor package from Whonix-Workstation to prevent Tor over Tor. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_dummytor
* Install an empty Tor package which does no more than simulating, that Tor is already installed and thus preventing the package manager from installing Tor, see also [[Dev/Dummy Tor]].
* DummyTor package description file: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/tor
* rinetd (see below) also prevents Tor from opening the default listener on port 9050. Therefore the Tor service will fail to start.

=== KDE / GNOME - application wide proxy settings ===

Whether KDE / GNOME will be used or not, in addition to stream isolation wrappers and other preconfigured applications for stream isolation, in addition it's useful to also configure KDE / GNOME - wide proxy settings. In case the user installs KDE or GNOME applications, which connect to the internet, which honor proxy settings, those won't go through Tor's TransPort, but through a dedicated SocksPort for further improved stream isolation. These settings are not system-wide, but KDE-wide / GNOME-wide.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* KDE: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/kde/share/config/kioslaverc
* GNOME: Not yet implemented. [[Dev/GNOME|TODO]]

== Extra ==

=== second, optional, extra firewall ===

Optional.

Optional second, optional, extra firewall for advanced users as damage protection in case the Whonix-Gateway gets ever compromised (Tor exploit).

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Please read the script comments.
* Firewall script: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/bin/whonix_firewall
* Configuration file: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/whonix_firewall.d/10_default

== Usability ==

=== Swap ===

Let the kernel only swap if it is absolutely necessary.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/sysctl.d/whonix-workstation-sysctl.conf

=== Environment Variables ===

Optional.

It's useful to have an environment variable announcing &quot;I am a Workstation&quot;, so applications such as TorButton and TorBirdy can act accordingly. (I.e. not starting Tor/Vidalia on the Workstation; not using 127.0.0.1 as proxy, but therefore the Gateway.)

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/profile.d/20_whonix.sh
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/profile.d/20_torbrowser.sh

=== apt.conf ===

Optional.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Doesn't do anything by default. Just some comments. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90whonix
* (apt is forced though Tor by apt-get uwt wrapper (Design-Shared) and by the firewall running on the Gateway.

=== http to socks converter ===

Optional.

Some applications don't support socks, but http. It's useful to have a http to socks converter.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* None required to be installed by default.
* If someone likes to use polipo, the config file from torproject.org is shipped. (Only adapted to use the Whonix-Gateway. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/polipo/config

=== Sending e-mails without registration ===

Optional.

Install a tool, which can send e-mails without registration.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Using Mixmaster. (Of course over Tor.)
* Implementation notes: [[Dev/Mixmaster]]
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/home/user/.Mix/mix.cfg
* Documented on [[Remailer]] and [[Mixmaster]] page.

=== GnuPG Configuration ===

Optional.

Using more secure defaults for GnuPG.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Using more secure defaults. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/home/user/.gnupg/gpg.conf

=== Project News Notification ===

Optional.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Using rawdog, a privacy friendly rss reader to download Whonix News Blogs.
* Privacy friendly as in, once it downloaded the blog's content, there will be no incoming/outgoing traffic. The page can be viewed offline and contains no tracking scripts.
* Non-ideal configuration. In rawdog config is a https link with a sourceforge rss feed, which unfortunately redirects to a non-https page, which rawdog follows. Thus, news isn't fetched over https and a man-in-the-middle could spread malicious news.
* rawdog Configuration folder: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/whonix_workstation/home/user/.rawdog/
* Documented on page [[rss]] and [[Download#Stay_tuned|Download (Stay Tuned)]] page.
* rawdog gets run by whonixcheck. (See [[Dev/Design-Shared]].)
* The user is asked to prefer to start Tor Browser using the Tor Browser Recommended shortcut on the Desktop: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/kde/share/applications/whonix-tbrecommend.desktop

=== TorChat Configuration ===

Optional.

Using TorChat on a already torified Workstation while preventing Tor over Tor isn't trivial. Therefore it's useful to ship required configuration files, preconfigured as much as possible by default to ease installation of TorChat.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* TorChat does '''not''' get installed by default.
* Due to popular request, Whonix makes it as easy as possible to use TorChat with Whonix.
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/home/user/.torchat/torchat.ini
* Documented on [[Chat]] page.
* Banning the Tor package from Whonix-Workstation to prevent Tor over Tor. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_dummytor

=== IRC Client ===

Optional.

Secure IRC Client configuration and script for getting a new IRC identity.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Whonix comes with XChat configured for privacy.
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/bin/xchat-reset
* Documented on [[XChat]] page.
* Configuration files. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/xchat2
* Deactivating plugins. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_xchat

=== Web Browser ===

Secure Web Browser, which doesn't suffer from likability and browser fingerprinting.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Whonix comes with Tor Browser, which is maintained by The Tor Project.
* Reasons for TorBrowser can be found on the [[Tor Browser]] page.
* Documented on [[Tor Browser]] page.
* torbrowser update script: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/bin/torbrowser
* Patched torbrowser startup script to make Tor Browser work without the bundled Tor and Vidalia: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/start-tor-browser The torbrowser update script https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/bin/torbrowser keeps care to replace the upstream start-tor-browser file.
* Install Tor Browser while building Whonix: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_torbrowser
* Environment variables: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/profile.d/20_torbrowser.sh
* Gpg keys to verify the downloaded Tor Browser:
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/gpg-pubkeys
** [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#OpenPGP_keys]]

=== rinetd ===

Optional.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* rinetd is configured to listen on local ports 9050 and 9150.
** rinetd forwards port 127.0.0.1:9050 (Workstation) to 192.168.0.10:9050 (Gateway).
** Forwards port 127.0.0.1:9150 (Workstation) to 192.168.0.10:9150 (Gateway).
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/rinetd.conf
** This prevents Tor over Tor by just installing Tor or by using the complete Tor Browser Bundle, which starts Vidalia and Tor. This is because, it listens on port 9050 and 9150 and therefore lets a default Tor or TBB fail to start.
** Should the Tor Browser update script ever break,
*** Whonix users can download (and verify) the stock Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) from torproject.org,
*** unpack to /home/user/tor-browser_en-US and
*** start it from the desktop menu shortcut or from the start menu.
*** As long as The Tor Project will still ship Vidalia with TBB: Starting with the stock startup script /home/user/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser will fail closed. Vidalia will report, that Tor won't connect, because port 9150 is already blocked by rinetd. This will be fixed as soon as The Tor Project merges a proposed patch https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5611 for the start-tor-browser startup script, which adds an optional environment variable, once set, only starts Tor Browser and not the bundled Tor/Vidalia.
*** As soon as The Tor Project moved to tor-launcher and drops Vidalia: Starting stock TBB inside Whonix should work out of the box, because https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/profile.d/20_torbrowser.sh sets the required environment variables to deactivate tor-launcher.

=== Marker file ===

Optional.

Add a marker file so scripts you write can find out, whether they are running on the Gateway or inside the Workstation. There are probably different implementations possible to reach that goal.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/whonix_workstation

=== Terminal Help ===

Optional.

Add a welcome and help message also to virtual terminals. (Those which can get started in graphical environments such as KDE and Konsole.)

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Default Debian .bashrc at the top and Whonix specific additions at the bottom: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/home/user/.bashrc
* Whonix-Workstation terminal help file: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/bin/whonix

== Debugging ==

=== Leaktest script ===

Optional.

Have a script to try to produce a leak and check if there are any leaks.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/bin/leaktest
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/leaktest
* [[Dev/Leak Tests]]

= Design-Shared =

Changes from [[Dev/Design-Shared]] also have to be added to the Gateway.

= Files =

== Essential ==

=== Anonymizer ===

An application to anonymize network traffic, called anonymizer, is required. The application to anonymize network traffic has to be obtained from a safe download source. Increase file maximum, if required by the anonymizer.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Whonix is based on Tor.
* Tor configuration file: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/tor/torrc.whonix
* Torproject's Debian repository added to package lists: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list
* Torproject's archive public key: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/gpg-pubkeys/torprojectarchive.asc
* Adding Torproject's archive public key to the apt package manager: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/40_add_torprojects_key
* Updating package lists to fetch metadata from torproject's repository: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/50_update_package_lists
* Installing Torprojects Debian package deb.torproject.org-keyring, which helps to keep Torprojects signing key current and installing tor tor-geoipdb tor-arm torsocks obfsproxy.: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_tor
* Increase file maximum, if required by the anonymizer: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/sysctl.d/whonix.conf

=== Network Configuration ===

The Gateway needs two network interfaces. An external interface to communicate with clearnet for Tor and an internal interface to communicate with the Workstation.

Disable IPv6, if not supported by the anonymity network.

Disable IP forwarding, if it is not required due to the firewall rules (such as in case of Tor, which offers a TransPort and a DNSPort).

Configure the system resolver to use the anonymity network to resolve DNS. - This is '''not''' required to anonymize traffic of the Workstation. The system resolver of the Gateway should not get used by any applications anyway, because they are explicitly configured to use the anonymity network. Useful as defence in depth. DNS and other traffic from the Workstation gets forced by the firewall to use the anonymity network. The Gateways's own traffic gets anonymized with the purpose of '''hiding the existence of the Gateway from the ISP''', because most users are expected, that they don't want to announce the existence of a Gateway, because that may indicate that they run hidden services or other less popular applications over Tor. The Gateway could alternatively fetch it's own operating system updates over clearnet, but since package selection is unique and implies, that a Gateway is in use and downloads are only authenticated and not encrypted, it's better to download the updates over the anonymity network. If an anonymity network with changing exit relays (and therefore exit ISPs) such as Tor is getting used, this also makes it much harder for an adversary to interfere with the update process. The last sentence gets elaborated on the Design-Shared page in chapter &quot;about package manager&quot;.

Prevent DHCP from updating the system resolver.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/2500_create-vbox-vm in function gateway_specific, two virtual network cards are added. The first one, type NAT. The second one, type internal.
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/network/interfaces.whonix
* Disable IPv6, Disable IP forwarding. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/sysctl.d/whonix-gateway-sysctl.conf
* Prevent DHCP from updating the system resolver. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/nodnsupdate
* Configure system resolver to use the anonymity network to resolve DNS. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/resolv.conf.whonix

=== Firewall ===

Add a firewall, which only allows traffic the anonymizer to connect to the internet.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Firewall script: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/usr/bin/whonix_firewall
* configuration file: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/whonix_firewall.d/10_default
* .d-style configuration folder: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/whonix_firewall.d/

== Debugging ==

=== Firewall Removal ===

'''Optional'''

Include a command to easily remove all firewall rules, which can not be run by accident without editing the file with root rights.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/usr/bin/dev_clearnet

=== Leaktest script ===

'''Optional'''

Have a script to try to produce a leak and check if there are any leaks.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/usr/bin/leaktest
* [[Dev/Leak Tests]]

=== Clearnet User ===

'''Optional'''

To have a user account &quot;clearnet&quot; on the Gateway may be helpful for debugging, an &quot;unsafe&quot; browser (which can be used to register public hotspots).

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_clearnetuser

== Usability ==

=== Tor Controller ===

'''Optional'''

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Arm is installed by default and documented on the [[Tor Controller]] page.
* Tor Controller startup script. Starting Tor controller without password by using &quot;sudo arm&quot;: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/whonix_gateway/usr/bin/arm

=== Help file ===

'''Optional'''

When the user types a short and easy command, the most important and most asked commands should be listed.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* User can type &quot;whonix&quot;.
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/usr/bin/whonix

=== Marker file ===

'''Optional'''

Add a marker file so scripts you write can find out, whether they are running on the Gateway or inside the Workstation. There are probably different implementations possible to reach that goal.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/usr/local/share/whonix/whonix_gateway

= Design-Shared =

Changes from [[Dev/Design-Shared]] also have to be added to the Gateway.

= Last updated git =

= Get Build Dependencies =

Install a tool to create Virtual Machine images (such as grml-debootstrap) and tools for mouting and apply other useful build configurations.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Configure apt-get and dpkg, to ask no questions while installing the build dependencies.
* Update the build machine's operating system.
* Configure apt-cacher-ng to speed up downloading when building multiple times (for debugging).
* Install tools used in the build process.
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/15_prepare-build-machine

= Get Base Operating System =

Use a tool to create a Virtual Machine base installation, which contains a secure operating system and which is bootable.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Used Debian for reasons explained on the [[Dev/Operating System]] design page.
* Whonix uses grml-debootstrap to build .img Virtual Machine images. The .img images are still virtualizer agnostic, can be run in a variety of virtualizers such as Qemu or Qubes OS. They can (and will in Whonix-Example-Implementation case) be converted to other formats to support other virtualizers (such as the .img format, which VirtualBox uses in case of Whonix).
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/20_create-debian-img
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/Whonix-Gateway_packages
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/Whonix-Workstation_packages
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/grml_config

Other Implementations:

* Old Whonix versions up to 0.3.0 used Ubuntu as base operating system.
* Old Whonix versions up to 0.3.0 used [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preseed Preseed], installed the operating system from DVD inside a Virtual Machine.
* This step can also be done manually, i.e. the user could be told to manually install some operating system.
* Whonix with [[Physical Isolation]].

= Backup Base Operating System =

Make a backup of that image. This is not strictly required, but you will want to modify that image often and want to start fresh often.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/25_backup-img

= Mount Image =

Mount the image, so files can be copied into it.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/mount-img

= Copy Files Into Image =

Copy configuration files and chroot scripts into the Virtual Machine image to transform it into a Gateway or Workstation.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Copying script: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/30_copy-into-img
* Verification script: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/32_verify_copied_files
* All files from whonix_gateway will get copied into Whonix-Gateway.
* All files from whonix_workstation will get copied into Whonix-Workstation.
* All files from whonix_shared will get copied into Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.

= Chrooting =

As preparation for the next step, there must be a method to chroot the mounted image.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/chroot-img

= Running Scripts inside Chroot =

The base operating system has to be modified. Some scripts need to be executed inside the virtual machines. This is called running chroot scripts.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/35_run-chroot-scripts-img

= Unchrooting =

The process of chrooting must be undone after the chroot scripts were executed.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/unchroot-img

= Unmounting =

The image must be unmounted after the copying files into it or after chrooting, running chroot scripts and unchrooting.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/unmount-img

= Creating a Virtual Machine package =

It's useful to deploy the Virtual Machine images through a package format, which makes it easy to import them for users.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Uses VirtualBox.
* VirtualBox does not support .img images, only .vdi (and others).
** Therefore the .img image has to be converted to .vdi.
*** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/40_convert-img-to-vdi
** The next step is to create a virtual machine description file.
*** After creating it, the Virtual Machine could be started.
*** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/45_create-vbox-vm
** An easy way to deploy Virtual Machine images is through the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format Open Virtualization Format] format (.ova images)
*** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/50_export-vbox-vm

= Files =

== Essential ==

=== Username, FQDN, hostname ===

Hosts file. Use non-identifying values for FQDN and hostname, because some applications may leak it. (Mixmaster is known to leak it.) Set FQDN to &quot;host.localdomain&quot; and set hostname to &quot;host&quot;. [https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-January/002457.html It's best when they are shared among anonymity focused distributions.]

It's recommended to work as non-privileged user and not using one will get into usability trouble (desktop environments don't like running as root). For usability, consistency, defence in depth, name it &quot;user&quot;. It's better to say non-saying operating system user account names and ideally share them among anonymity focused distributions since the user could accidentally leak it (ex: ssh).

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Set FQDN to &quot;host.localdomain&quot; and set hostname to &quot;host&quot;: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/hosts
* adding user account &quot;user&quot;: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/30_adduser_user
* configuring hostname &quot;host&quot;: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/20_create-debian-img
* Even though grml-debootstrap already creates /etc/hostname with content &quot;host&quot;, it's useful for physical isolation users, who set up the wrong host while installing: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/hostname
* More information about the shared user name &quot;user&quot;: [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]]

=== Operating System Updates ===

Configure the package manager.

Configure software repositories.

Do not use the default automatic updates mechanism and use higher timeouts. It's better to disable the operating system's default automatic update mechanism, because times of automatic run are too predictable. The network fingerprint (not web fingerprint) could help an ISP guessing, that there is a network hidden operating system.

Notify about operating system updates in a safe way.

Misc settings, higher timeouts, more retries when package download or DNS resolution fails. This is useful because anonymity networks are slow and otherwise updating would occasionally fail due to network problems.

Must have a secure operating system updater (package manager), i.e. must not fall through the [https://www.updateframework.com/wiki/Docs/Security#AttacksandWeaknesses TUF Threat Model] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6F7Io2ncN w]). Additionally, downloading should go thought an anonymity network, with changing exit relays. This makes an adversary less likely to interfere with the update process, because updates go through different ISPs, which makes it much more difficult to mount a man-in-the-middle attack over an extended amount of time.

The package manager shouldn't confuse the user with questions to keep the locally installed configuration file or to install the new version from the upstream package maintainer.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Gateway and Workstation updates go through Tor. (Due to Firewall, Network Configuration and Stream Isolation Wrapper, details in Design-Shared/Gateway/Workstation.)
* Whonix uses Debian ftp.us.debian.org and security.debian.org repositories.
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list
* Disable the operating system's default automatic update mechanism.
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20whonix-noperiodic
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/kde/share/config/apper
* Higher timeouts, more retries.
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90whonix-timeout
* For the safe update notification, see check mechanism (whonixcheck) below.
* Disable Apper (packagekit) automatic download of package lists (due to upstream bugs https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62575 and https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62576)
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/kde/share/config/apper

=== TimeSync ===

Add a secure method with distributed trust to obtain date and time, because a clock which is drift, is bad for anonymity.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

General Information

* [[TimeSync]]
* tails_htp configuration file: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/default/htpdate
* When timesync is run by cron, it adds a random delay to prevent having a predictable network (not web) fingerprint. Essentially runs tails_htp every hour at a random time.

Start Hooks

* tails_htp init script: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/init.d/htpdate
* Using cron to start it every hour: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/cron.hourly/30_timesync
* The file https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/timesync_hourly gets run by https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/cron.hourly/30_timesync cron every hour.
* Auto start Boot Clock Randomization: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/etc/init.d/bootclockrandomization
* Auto start timesync status notification after (auto) login Whonix-Gateway: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/profile.d/30_timesync.sh
* Workstation specific
** Auto start timesync status notification after (auto) login Whonix-Workstation: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/home/user/.config/autostart/timesync.desktop

Install Hooks

* Adding tails_htp daemon user account and init script: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_htp
* Install Boot Clock Randomization init script: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_bootclockrandomization
* Install Time Sanity Check init script: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_timesanitycheck

Supporting Files

* /etc/sudoers.d/
** Allow Network Time Synchronization (tails htpdate) without password: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/sudoers.d/htpdate
** Allow &quot;sudo service bootclockrandomization status&quot; without a password: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/sudoers.d/bootclockrandomization
** Allow &quot;sudo service timesanitycheck status&quot; and &quot;restart&quot; without a password: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/sudoers.d/timesanitycheck
* Delay console output a bit when run after login. This ensures /etc/motd is shown earlier and introduces the status notifications gracefully. Better look and feel: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/delay
* Icon. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/icons/timesync.ico

Script

* htpdate (tails_htp) itself: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/sbin/htpdate
* Combined graphical and text user interface &quot;timesync&quot; main script. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/timesync
* Combined graphical and text user interface &quot;timesync&quot; scripts folder. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/timesync-scripts and some from https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/whonixcheck-scripts (which are sourced becomes clear by reading the main https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/timesync script)

=== Banned Packages ===

Some packages aren't suited for an anonymous operating system. Reasons are privacy issues or messing with network settings. Ensure, that those get removed, if they got installed by the virtual machine image creation tool. This shouldn't be the case because of the hand selected package selection. Just in case upstream dependencies change or custom packages get added by users who build from source code. Ensure that those packages won't get installed by accident. Since it's documented, advanced users can overwrite these recommendations if they know better.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_banned_packages
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/apt/preferences.d/50_banned-packages

=== Stream Isolation Wrapper ===

Stream isolate different applications to prevent identity correlation through circuit sharing. To my knowledge, only the anonymizer Tor supports this feature.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* See [[Stream Isolation]].
* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/torsocks uwt] is a wrapper arround torsocks: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/uwt
* uwt / timeprivacy master wrapper: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/uwtwrapper
* uwt configuration folder (.d-style): https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/whonix.d/
* Application wrapper symlinks to the master wrapper (If the application isn't installed, the wrapper doesn't do anything. So having one more installed than necessary, doesn't matter.): https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_uwt

== Extra ==

=== Time Privacy ===

Applications such as gpg and git embed time stamps in their output. For improved privacy it may make sense to fake this data. The user should enable it oneself, otherwise it could be very surprising and may not do what the user wants. Experimental design and implementation. Disabled by default.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Disabled by default.
* timeprivacy script: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/timeprivacy
* uwt / timeprivacy master wrapper: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/uwtwrapper
* Time Privacy configuration folder (.d-style): https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/whonix.d/
* Application wrapper symlinks to the master wrapper (If the application isn't installed, the wrapper doesn't do anything. So having one more installed than necessary, doesn't matter.): https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_uwt

=== hdd configuration / swap / Disk uuid / dbus machine-id ===

Since the virtual machine creation tool won't create a swap partition (which is actually good because it simplifies the setup) but the system could run out of memory, add a swap file. The is optional depending on the operating system and available RAM. Configure swap to be used as little as possible to improve speed.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Swap file creation. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_create_swap_file
* Activating swap in fstab. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/fstab
* Only swap to disk if really necessary. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/etc/sysctl.d/whonix.conf
* Less Important Identifies (Defined as per [[Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection]].)
** Share Disk UUIDs.
*** In /etc/fstab. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/fstab
*** Also share uuid for swap file. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_create-swap-file
** Chang partition uuid. &quot;''tune2fs /dev/mapper/loop0p1 -U 26ada0c0-1165-4098-884d-aafd2220c2c6''&quot; https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/35_run-chroot-scripts-img
** Change disk uuid: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/45_create-vbox-vm
** Share dbus machine-id: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/var/lib/dbus/machine-id

=== Base Files ===

Perhaps only required for Debian and derivatives. Whonix was asked to replace the default dpkg origin symlink.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/dpkg/origins/whonix
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_symlinks

== Usability ==

=== check mechanism ===

Recommended, not strictly required.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

General Information

* [[whonixcheck]]
* Whonixcheck essentially runs whonixcheck at least once very day.
* Whonixcheck, although run on each boot and every hour by cron, itself is rate limited and stops running checks, if it was run less than one day ago. The user can always manually perform all whonixcheck checks.

Start Hooks

* The file https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/whonixcheck_hourly gets run by cron.hourly https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/cron.hourly/40_whonixcheck
* Allowing messages to tty (setting &quot;mesg y&quot;) while an application was started in background (by cron): https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/profile.d/20_mesg.sh
* Whonix-Gateway specific
** https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/profile.d/40_whonixcheck.sh gets run on every (automatic) login.
* Whonix-Workstation specific
** Since Whonix-Workstation is graphical, it's better to use the event by the desktop environment than using profile.d for autostart. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/home/user/.config/autostart/whonixcheck.desktop

Supporting Files

* Allows running apt-get update as user (non-root): https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/sudoers.d/apt-get-update
* Allow wall (with -nobanner option) without password: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/sudoers.d/wall
* Version file to let the whonixcheck find out which version of Whonix is locally installed. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/version
* apt-get-update (which has an sudoers exception) runs apt-get update. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/apt-get-update
* When automatically run by autostart or cron, whonixcheck adds a random delay (to prevent having a predictable network (not web) fingerprint.

* The whonixcheck main script. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/whonixcheck
* The folder with the various checks. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/whonixcheck-scripts

=== Desktop Environment ===

Optional.

It's useful to have a desktop preconfigured to make it as easy as possible for users who use Linux for the first time.

=== sudoers ===

Optional. For convenience. Only recommended for Virtual Machines.

Allow shutdown, reboot and poweroff without a password. Allow starting Tor Controller arm without password. (No effect on Workstation, since arm is only Gateway.) Allow mixmaster-update without password. (No effect on Gateway, since mixmaster is only installed on Gateway.)

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/sudoers.d/reboot
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/sudoers.d/arm
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/sudoers.d/mixmaster-update

=== Console Autologin ===

Optional. Only recommended for virtual machines.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/inittab

=== Console Default Password Hint ===

Optional.

The system will be shipped with a default password (which users are suggested to change in documentation). To prevent user frustration when not knowing the password it greatly reduced (from Whonix experience) support requests if the default password is displayed right above the password prompt.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/issue

=== Console Welcome Message ===

Optional.

Contains general information about derivative, licensing, default passwords, how to open the help file.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/motd

=== Deactivate display power saving in Virtual Machines ===

Since it's confusing and not useful and not saving any energy. (Needs to be applied on host.)

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/profile.d/20_disable_powersaving.sh

=== boot manager configuration ===

Optional. For higher boot resolution, it's required to run update-grub after changing grub configuration files.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Not yet functional.
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/etc/grub.d/50_whonix
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_grub

=== update command not found ===

Optional.

Initially update the command not found database, to prevent showing &quot;please run update-command-not-found&quot; in case a non-existent command gets entered in console.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_update_command_not_found

=== Secure/SSL Command Line Downloader ===

Add a command line downloader, which enforces using https (SSL).

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* A simple curl wrapper. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/scurl
* Documented under [[Software#scurl_-_SSL_command_line_downloader|scurl - SSL command line downloader]]
* The user starts scurl, the wrapper will run the curl uwt wrapper (/usr/bin/curl), which stream isolates and finally calls curl.

=== Slim Down ===

Optional. To safe space and to prevent (some) development related leaks, remove cache, temporary files, dhcp leases, package manager cache, logs, history.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/80_slimdown

=== Icons ===

Optional.

Some pretty icons for the start menu and the desktop for custom applications, which are only useful in a Gateway/Workstation design.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/tree/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/icons

== Debugging ==

=== Sanity Checks ===

Recommended, not strictly required.

Some simple tests to check for example, if all files have been correctly copied into the image, if the package manager is fully functional, because some virtual machine creation tools build broken images. Package integrity checks.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/32_verify_copied_files
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/10_root_check
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/20_sanity_checks

=== Misc ===

Optional.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Chroot Script Skeleton, not strictly required, might just be useful to explain how to create chroot-scripts: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_skeleton
* Create a list of all files inside Whonix source folder. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/list_source_files
* List of all files inside Whonix source code with comments: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/development/files_list
* Commented list of files inside Whonix source code that may require special treatment when creating a Whonix-Gateway/Workstation.deb (which is planned): https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/development/files_list_short

=== Variables ===

Recommended, not strictly required.

It's useful to configure the system, not to ask any questions which require user interaction such as when you plan to run the package manager from within chroot. This is because interaction isn't useful when automating things.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/variables

=== Package Cache ===

Optional.

If the package manager is used inside chroot, it makes sense to run it though a cache, so debugging steps can be done faster.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* apt.conf which can be used in case apt-get gets used inside chroot. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/apt.conf

What is ''/usr/local/share/whonix/apt.conf'' good for?

This apt.conf is only used inside chroot and currently only in effect for &quot;''./debug-steps/download-source -tg''&quot; and &quot;''./debug-steps/download-source -tw''&quot;.

It points to ''http://192.168.0.11:3142'', which is expected to be a Whonix-Workstation with apt-cacher-ng running. It's useful for running &quot;''apt-get install''&quot; and &quot;''apt-get source''&quot; inside chroot, because downloads are cached, which speeds up the build process when building several times in a row. (Debugging with only minor changes.)

In case you don't want to use it or to use another proxy, edit ''/home/user/Whonix/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/apt.conf'' (comment out with a # or change proxy settings). Don't forget &quot;''sudo ./build-steps.d/30_copy-into-img -tX''&quot; after modifying the file.

* Script to run apt-cacher-ng through uwt for Stream Isolation. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/bin/apt-cacher-ng_uwt

=== Prevent daemons from starting inside chroot ===

Optional.

Only in case you want to install something inside chroot for debugging purposes. Otherwise they can lock the chroot folder and you won't be able to unchroot.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* policy-rc.d blocks daemons from starting. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/policy-rc.d
* policy-rc.d gets copied into chroot when chrooting. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/chroot-img
* policy-rc.d gets deleted inside chroot when leaving chroot. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/unchroot-img

=== Indicate last chroot script ===

Not strictly required. A chroot script, which indicates that all went well.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/90_end

=== Lower priority while building ===

Optional. Not strictly required.

Using ionice and renice.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/pre

=== Enable debugging ===

Optional. Not strictly required.

When using bash, set -x to show each command that gets executed.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/pre

=== Error handling ===

Optional. Not strictly required.

It's important to ensure that there are no error while copying files into the images or while running the chroot scripts because many steps are essential. Stop and loudly complain if any unexpected error occurs.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* general trap: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/pre
* using traps and exit 1 everywhere

=== Delete Virtual Machine files ===

Optional. Not strictly required.

So they can be re-created for debugging purposes.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/debug-steps/delete-vbox-vm

=== Interactive Chroot ===

Optional. Not strictly required.

After creating the base operating system image, after copying files into it or after applying the chroot scripts, it's useful to have a command, which allows to look around inside the image without having to boot the image. Adrelanos calls this Interactive Chroot.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/debug-steps/interactive-chroot-img

== Licensing ==

Only required for builds, which will be redistributed in public.

Make a list of GPLed software.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Added [http://dberkholz.com/2004/02/ damngpl]. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/damngpl
* Creating a list of GPLed software. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_sources
* A script to download all GPLed software, which can be run inside the virtual machine or inside chroot. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/whonix_download_sources
* The source code needs a License file. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/COPYING

= Build Automation =

Optional. Not strictly required.

Since many steps are required to build a Gateway or Workstation, it's useful to automate build creation.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_build
* [[Dev/Build Documentation]]

= Release Automation =

Optional. Not strictly required.

Since many steps are required to redistribute a Gateway or Workstation, it's useful to automate releases.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* Release maintenance folder: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/README
* sourceforge.net Download Readme: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/README
* Whonix News File: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/whonix_news
* Script to automate gpg signing, verification (as sanity check) and upload sourceforge.net Download Readme: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/upload_download_readme
* Script to automate gpg signing, verification (as sanity check) and upload Whonix News File: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/upload_whonix_news
* Building and uploading of Virtual Machine Images. Fully documented on [[Dev/Redistribution]] and https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/release/whonix_release.

= Other important things =

The things on this (Design-Shared) page are supposed to be added to the Gateway and the Workstation.

To build a Gateway, also things from the [[Dev/Design-Gateway]] page have to be added.

To build a Workstation, also things from the [[Dev/Design-Workstation]] page have to be added.

Justify other design decisions, what the project doesn't and what it doesn't do. Have loads of documentation. Have a source code hacking guide and source code introduction.

Whonix-Example-Implementation:

* [[Dev/Design-Gateway]]
* [[Dev/Design-Workstation]]
* [[Design]]
* [[Documentation]]
* [[Dev/Developer Portal]]
* [[Dev/Source Code Intro]]

'''This is outdated documentation which no longer applies. Kept in case it will be required again in future.'''

= Updating Tor =

Tor was installed on Whonix according to [https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian#ubuntu official instructions for Ubuntu]. You can update Tor (and the rest of the system) using ''apt-get update'' and ''apt-get dist-upgrade''.

If you run in the following error message when running ''apt-get update'' on the Gateway...

&lt;pre&gt;W: GPG error: http://deb.torproject.org precise Inrelease: The following signature were invalid: Keyexpired 1346668560&lt;/pre&gt;

...or into the following error message on the Gateway when running ''apt-get dist-upgrade'':

&lt;pre&gt;Warning: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
deb.torproject.org-keyring tor
Install these packages without varification?&lt;/pre&gt;

...please use the workaround below. Please do not install without verification for your own safety!

Temporary fix. Run these two commands. (Check if they are still current and genuine in official instructions for Ubuntu.)

&lt;pre&gt;gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 886DDD89

gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -&lt;/pre&gt;

(If they fail for the first time, perhaps because you are on a slow network or slow Tor circuit, run them a few times until the succeed.)

,, Technical problem: The latest Whonix release is a few days ago and in meanwhile there is a new deb.torproject.org-keyring got renewed while the old torproject deb keys expired. Fixing the problem requires a new Whonix release. It will be fixed in 0.3.0.

= VirtualBox Guest Additions =

== Introduction ==

Written and tested with Whonix 0.2.1 (Ubuntu precise). Many things can go wrong and none or the very least of them will be caused by Whonix. This has only limited support by the Whonix developers, because 1. it's not recommended for security reasons and 2. the guest additions related bugs and instructions are somewhat out of the scope of the Whonix project.

Installation is somewhat difficult and no packages exist. Just search the internet and you'll see, that loads of people having issues installing the VirtualBox guest additions. People having problems for years. VMware is of no alternative, people are also having trouble installing the VMware tools into Linux guests. The issue with the guest additions is ridiculous. For years no solution has been found. With each kernel update, recompilation is required, and quite often, due to some updates, complication becomes difficult or impossible for a long time.

Also see article, [[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page#news_item&amp;px#OTk5Mw|The VirtualBox Kernel Driver Is Tainted Crap]].

If you are having trouble, than in most cases not because of Whonix. The Whonix setup is a regular Ubuntu Linux and VirtualBox. You can try asking the regular VirtualBox and Ubuntu resources if you have trouble.

= TorChat source package =

== HowTo ==

'''EXPERIMENTAL''' Experimental as in it is difficult to install. Only use it in case you trust TorChat. There shouldn't be any anonymity leaks and it should be as safe as other hidden services in general and in Whonix.

Learn about [[Hidden Services]] in Whonix first and learn how to set up the hidden webserver. This will ease following this guide.

On Whonix-Gateway.

Open your {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc&lt;/pre&gt;

Add.

&lt;pre&gt;HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/torchat_service/
HiddenServicePort 11009 192.168.0.11:11009&lt;/pre&gt;

Save. Reload Tor.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service tor reload&lt;/pre&gt;

On Whonix-Gateway.

Install dependencies.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install python python-wxgtk2.8&lt;/pre&gt;

Get your onion address.

&lt;pre&gt;nano /var/lib/tor/torchat_service/hostname&lt;/pre&gt;

Backup your key, if you want to ever restore it one another machine, a newer Whonix-Workstation or after hdd failure.

&lt;pre&gt;/var/lib/tor/torchat_service/private_key&lt;/pre&gt;

Download the latest Python version of TorChat source code, for example as time of writing torchat-source-0.9.9.553.zip - Python source code (classic standalone 0.9.9 version) from (https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/downloads) and store it in ''/home/user''.

Unpack.

&lt;pre&gt;unzip torchat-source-0.9.9.553.zip&lt;/pre&gt;

Get into the torchat source folder. For example.

&lt;pre&gt;cd /home/user/torchat-source-0.9.9.553/&lt;/pre&gt;

Get into the src folder.

&lt;pre&gt;cd src&lt;/pre&gt;

Get into the Tor folder.

&lt;pre&gt;cd Tor&lt;/pre&gt;

Rename tor.sh.

&lt;pre&gt;mv tor.sh backup_tor.sh&lt;/pre&gt;

Go back to the src folder.

&lt;pre&gt;cd ..&lt;/pre&gt;

Create torchat.ini.

&lt;pre&gt;nano torchat.ini&lt;/pre&gt;

Add the following content.

&lt;pre&gt;[client]
listen_interface = 192.168.0.11
listen_port = 11009
own_hostname = &lt;your onion hostname without .onion&gt;

[tor]
tor_server = 192.168.0.10
tor_server_control_port = 9154
tor_server_socks_port = 9154

[tor_portable]
tor_server = 192.168.0.10
tor_server_control_port = 9154
tor_server_socks_port = 9154&lt;/pre&gt;

Make torchat executable.

&lt;pre&gt;chmod +x torchat.py&lt;/pre&gt;

Run torchat.

&lt;pre&gt;./torchat&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Alternative ===

After installing the dependencies we could also force install the torchat deb package.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo dpkg -i --force-depends torchat-0.9.9.553.deb&lt;/pre&gt;

And then configure the files inside ''/home/user/.torchat''. I don't know if that may be the better way.

= Mixmaster =

== MX capable DNS resolver ==

No longer required.

Mixmaster needs to resolve MX DNS records, [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7829 while Tor does not support that]. We have to install a DNS resolver capable of doing that. It still comes with caveats.

Required knowledge:

* Introduction chapter of [[Secondary DNS Resolver]]

The [[Secondary DNS Resolver#example-with-cznic-labs-dns-resolver|Example with CZ.NIC Labs DNS resolver]] worked in this case.

Security considerations when replacing the system wide DNS resolver:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third party DNS resolver traffic goes through its own circuit, which is good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All (custom installed) applications not configured to use a SocksPort (see [Stream Isolation]), would resolve their DNS through the system wide DNS resolver, which would be the third party resolver, giving too much power to it, because it's always the same, only one service provider, not changing like Tor circuits but static. ## Install Postfix ##&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo apt-get install postfix ## configure postfix as sattelite system, default settings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Technical background: Mixmaster requires either - a) An (open) smtp server SMTPRELAY in ''/etc/mixmaster/remailer.conf''. Unfortunately, I haven't found any open smtp server (search term: open relay). A mailserver where the user registers first would probably work, but this would defeat the original idea: sending e-mails without depending on registration. Or, - b) a mta (mail transfer agent), which speaks to the remailer directly. '''TODO''': Are there enough Tor exit relays, which allow the SMTP port and does their ISP allow to speak SMTP? If there are too few servers, it could be bad for anonymity.

Open ''/etc/postfix/main.cf''.

&lt;pre&gt;kdesudo kwrite /etc/postfix/main.cf&lt;/pre&gt;

Replace the content with the following.

&lt;pre&gt;# See /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.dist for a commented, more complete version


# Debian specific:  Specifying a file name will cause the first
# line of that file to be used as the name.  The Debian default
# is /etc/mailname.
#myorigin = /etc/mailname

smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name (Debian/GNU)
biff = no

# appending .domain is the MUA's job.
append_dot_mydomain = no

# Uncomment the next line to generate &quot;delayed mail&quot; warnings
#delay_warning_time = 4h

readme_directory = no

# TLS parameters
smtpd_tls_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
smtpd_tls_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
smtpd_use_tls=yes
smtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtpd_scache
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache

# See /usr/share/doc/postfix/TLS_README.gz in the postfix-doc package for
# information on enabling SSL in the smtp client.

myhostname = host.localdomain
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
mydestination = host, host.localdomain, localhost.localdomain, localhost
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128
mailbox_command = 
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
inet_interfaces = loopback-only
inet_protocols = all

relayhost = 1.1.1.1
#relayhost = 2.2.2.2&lt;/pre&gt;

== Debugging Postfix ==

Looking into the mail log.

&lt;pre&gt;tail -f /var/log/mail.info&lt;/pre&gt;

Should contain something like this.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt; debian postfix/pickup[id]: id2: uid=1000 from=&lt;user&gt;
&lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt; debian postfix/cleanup[id]: id2: message-id=&lt;id3.id4@host.localdomain&gt;
&lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt; debian postfix/qmgr[id]: id2: from=&lt;user@host.localdomain&gt;, size=30000, nrcpt=1 (queue active)
&lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt; debian postfix/smtp[300]: id2: to=&lt;remailer@breaka.net&gt;, relay=mail.breaka.net[202.75.54.8]:25, delay=30, delays=0.30/0.01/30/3.0, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (250 OK id=id5-id6-id7)
&lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt; debian postfix/qmgr[id]: id2: removed
&lt;/pre&gt;

Reading local mail.

&lt;pre&gt;## Either with cli tool mail.
mail

## Or using gui tool Icedove (Debian version of Mozilla Thunderbird)
## using movemail.&lt;/pre&gt;

If all went well, there will be no local mail. Only error messages result in local mails.

= Bugs =

* In Whonix 0.4.5, due to a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7668 Tor Browser upstream bug] (they forgot to update the changelog) and because the keyserver is/was down, the torbrowser and whonixcheck script in Whonix can no longer find out which Tor Browser version is locally installed. ([https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/6122990d/ Whonix Bug Report]) The [[TorBrowser#update-tor-browser|Update Tor Browser]] chapter contains a workaround and a fix is available for testers.

Users, who have an (anonymous) sourceforge.net account, could go to the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/ Whonix sf.net Project Page], scroll down to ''Update Notifications'' and hit the ''Subscribe to Updates'' button. They would receive notifications about new releases sent to their (anonymous) [E-Mail] address.

There is currently no way for users to subscribe to sf.net blogs or wiki, but such a feature [https://sourceforge.net/p/allura/tickets/5702/ has been requested].

== Sourceforge.net E-Mail Notification ==

Didn't work reliable.

E-mail notification: For users having an account on sf.net, there is on [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/code/ sf.net] git is an [[E-Mail]] subscribe button: '''M'''.

This is an example how such a mail could look like:

= Restrict Flash Settings =
'''You can skip this chapter. It's no longer of use, because if you use BetterPrivacy as recommended above, you won't need this.'''

Flash applications can set cookies, so-called Local Shared Objects (LSO), independently of the browser's settings. These cookies are able to save data up to 100 Kb. Usually, they save settings but they may be used to track surfers as well.

In order to manage the settings of your Adobe Flash Player, Macromedia offers a [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html Flash application] on its website. There you may e.g. configure the rules concerning the data storage and the rights for using camera and microphone. The settings are spread over several flash applications. Deactivate all functions that allow sharing and saving of data. The storage of LSOs may be deactivated on the [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html Global Storage Settings panel].

Hint: Only in case you previously deactivated JavaScript: You must have Javascript enabled for adobe.com and macromedia.com temporary to run the Flash application. 

[[Image:flash1.png|none]]

Furthermore, the cookies already saved have to be deleted. This functionality may be found on the [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html Website Storage Settings panel].

[[Image:flash2.png|none]]

Personal side note: you see how ridiculous that plugin is, if the usage of the Flash settings manager depends on their website being reachable.

= Build Documentation dpkg-source commit =
To dpkg commit changes, run the debian upstream tarball creation script.

&lt;pre&gt;
./help-steps/make-debian-package-upstream-tarball
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then run.

&lt;pre&gt;
dpkg-source --commit
&lt;/pre&gt;

When it asks &quot;Enter the desired patch name:&quot; just enter anything you wish, for example &quot;buildconfig&quot;. In the following window, you don't have to fill out anything. Just save and close the editor. &lt;ref&gt;This will create a Debian quilt patch.&lt;/ref&gt; You only have to do this once and won't be asked again to do this, unless you add another change which needs to be dpkg-source committed.

If you want to undo the dpkg-source committed change, check the contents of the {{Code|.pc}} and the {{Code|debian/patches}} folder and delete it.
= Build Documentation - Override Whonix Version =
Since the Whonix debian package version number is auto derived from {{Code|git describe}} and used for [[Download#Whonix_Version_Check_and_Whonix_News|Whonix News]] download, it is recommended to override it. &lt;ref&gt;Alternatively, you could deactivate or override [[Download#Whonix_Version_Check_and_Whonix_News|Whonix News]] in the whonixcheck script and manually stay on top of news.&lt;/ref&gt; You could add a file to {{Code|buildconfig.d}}, for example {{Code|buildconfig.d/50_version}} and add for example.

&lt;pre&gt;
temp=&quot;$WHONIX_BUILD_CLOSEST_GIT_TAG&quot;

## Using `export`, so whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-post.d/70_log_build_version can read it.
export WHONIX_BUILD_WHONIX_VERSION_NEW=&quot;$(echo &quot;$temp&quot; | sed 's/-/./g')&quot;

echo &quot;WHONIX_BUILD_WHONIX_VERSION_NEW: $WHONIX_BUILD_WHONIX_VERSION_NEW&quot;

WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION=&quot;&quot;$WHONIX_BUILD_WHONIX_VERSION_NEW&quot;&quot;-debpackage&quot;&quot;$WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_DEB_REVISION_VERSION&quot;&quot;

echo &quot;WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION: $WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

While building, check if WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION looks sane. &lt;ref&gt;For example {{Code|WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION: 2:6.13.g4218c564e556cb68a3f18dc4040db5353690706c}} does not look sane, but {{Code|WHONIX_BUILD_NEW_CHANGELOG_VERSION: 2:6-debpackage1}} looks sane.&lt;/ref&gt;

If you added a new file to {{Code|buildconfig.d}}, for example {{Code|buildconfig.d/50_target_arch}}, those have to be dpkg-source committed before building Whonix. Otherwise you'll get an error message. (Which looks like this:&lt;ref name=dpkgcommit&gt;

= XChat =
{{Old-Stable-0.5.6}}

All XChat plugins have been deactivated (hardening) and moved to /usr/lib/xchat/plugins.disabled. If you really need a plugin, such as perl for SASL, you can use the example below.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo mv /usr/lib/xchat/plugins.disabled/perl.so /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/&lt;/pre&gt;

= Manually updating Tor Browser (Whonix 0.5.6) =
{{Old-Stable-0.5.6}}

(1) Go to https://www.torproject.org/ and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/ and download the Tor Browser Bundle for Linux 32 bit. Store it in ''/home/user/''.

(2) Read https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and learn about gpg verification.

(3) Go to https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/signing-keys.html.en to get the gpg keys.

(4) Verify the Tor Browser Bundle download.

(5) Go into ''/home/user/'' with the file manger. (Dolphin)

(6) Extract the Tor Browser Bundle. Right click on the downloaded archive -&gt; extract -&gt; extract archive here.

(7) In case you downloaded another version than ''en-US'', rename the tor-browser_''lang'' folder to ''tor-browser_en-US''. This is important, because the paths in the following script are hardcoded.

(8) Go into the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US'' folder.

(9) Delete ''start-tor-browser'' or move it to the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/Docs'' folder.

(10) Create a new file within the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/'' folder called ''start-tor-browser'' with the following content.

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash
## Whonix Tor Browser start script

export TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1
    
cd ~
~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile
    
## End of Whonix Tor Browser start script
&lt;/pre&gt;

(11) Make the ''start-tor-browser'' script executable. Right click on ''start-tor-browser'' -&gt; Properties -&gt; Permissions -&gt; enable the ''Is executable'' box -&gt; ok.

(12) Go to ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile/'' and create a file ''user.js'' with the following content.

&lt;pre&gt;## Begin of patched user.js.

## If you edit this file while Firefox is running, your changes will be
## overwritten, when you close Firefox.

## How to create the user.js network settings:
## 1. Make a backup of prefs.js.
## 1. Start Tor Browser with the patched start script.
## 2. Apply proxy settings using the Tor Button settings dialog..
## 3. Make a diff from the old and the new pref.js.
## 4. Copy the relevant changes to user.js.

## network settings
## (Are now set in /etc/environment - or not...)
## (See /etc/environment.)
user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.use_privoxy&quot;, false);
user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.settings_method&quot;, &quot;custom&quot;);
user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.socks_host&quot;, &quot;192.168.0.10&quot;);
user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.socks_port&quot;, 9100);
user_pref(&quot;network.proxy.socks&quot;, &quot;192.168.0.10&quot;);
user_pref(&quot;network.proxy.socks_port&quot;, 9100);
user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_host&quot;, &quot;192.168.0.10&quot;);
user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_port&quot;, 9100);

## End of Whonix user.js.
&lt;/pre&gt;

(13) If you want to make 100% sure you never have Tor over Tor, you must shut down Whonix-Gateway while doing the following.

(14) Delete /home/user/my_tor-browser_en-US/App/tor.

(15) If there is '''no''' green Vidalia icon in the task bar, everything is fine.

(16) Start Tor Browser and run

&lt;pre&gt;ps aux | grep tor&lt;/pre&gt;

If you see something like.

&lt;pre&gt;109 /usr/sbin/tor&lt;/pre&gt;

Or.

&lt;pre&gt;/home/user/my_tor-browser_en-US/App/tor&lt;/pre&gt;

Something went wrong and you're running Tor over Tor, which is recommended against.

(17) If the tests results are as expected, everything went fine.

(18) Don't forget to restart Whonix-Gateway, if you shut it down in step (13).

(19) Done.

= DummyTor =
== Introduction ==
{{Old-Stable-0.5.6}}

Whonix-Workstation has an empty Tor package installed by default, called Dummy Tor package. It contains no files, besides some default files&lt;ref&gt;changelog.gz copyright README.Debian control control.tar.gz data.tar.gz debian-binary md5sums&lt;/ref&gt;, which are required to create a dummy package. Debian packages are standard Unix '''ar''' archives, auditors can unpack and check them.

The reason for installing the Dummy Tor package inside Whonix-Workstation is to prevent installing the Tor package from the upstream (Debian or The Tor Project) repository, to prevent running Tor over Tor. This allows installation of packages, which depend on Tor, such as [[Chat#TorChat|TorChat]] and parcimonie on Whonix-Workstation.

To prevent the package from upgrading

&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;tor hold&quot; | sudo dpkg --set-selections&lt;/pre&gt;

has been run while building Whonix from source code.

To check the status an auditor could run.

&lt;pre&gt;dpkg --get-selections | grep tor&lt;/pre&gt;

To undo holding the packing a user could run.

&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;tor install&quot; | sudo dpkg --set-selections&lt;/pre&gt;

== Implementation ==
{{Old-Stable-0.5.6}}

* Everything is inside the ''whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/'' folder in Whonix source code
* and subsequently in /usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/ in Whoix-Workstation.
* .deb package format
* /usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/tor is the control file
* /usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/tor_1.0_all.deb is the package which was installed using dpkg by whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix_internal_install_script.
* whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/dummytor/dummytor is the &quot;build script&quot; for the package, which is actually only a single &quot;equivs-build ./tor&quot; command.

== Remove Proxy Settings - Whonix 0.5.6 ==
{{Old-Stable-0.5.6}}

It's best to get a fresh copy of Tor Browser, which has never been started before.

Whonix modifies user.js as documented in the [[Tor_Browser#Whonix_Proxy_Settings_.2F_user.js|Tor Browser chapter]].

Open ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US_my/Data/profile/user.js''.

&lt;pre&gt;kwrite /home/user/tor-browser_en-US_my/Data/profile/user.js&lt;/pre&gt;

Comment out all network settings.&lt;ref&gt;These steps are required to remove proxy settings.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;TOR_SOCKS_HOST and TOR_SOCKS_PORT were set for [[Stream Isolation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
## network settings
#user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.use_privoxy&quot;, false);
#user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.settings_method&quot;, &quot;custom&quot;);
#user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.socks_host&quot;, &quot;192.168.0.10&quot;);
#user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.socks_port&quot;, 9100);
#user_pref(&quot;network.proxy.socks&quot;, &quot;192.168.0.10&quot;);
#user_pref(&quot;network.proxy.socks_port&quot;, 9100);
#user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_host&quot;, &quot;192.168.0.10&quot;);
#user_pref(&quot;extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_port&quot;, 9100);
&lt;/pre&gt;

You could use Tor Button's settings dialog to set it to any other proxy or transparent torification. The latter means &quot;no proxy&quot;, which will result in Tor Browser using whatever the operating system provides and if you don't have a VPN installed inside Whonix-Workstation, it will go through Tor's TransPort.

If you are using the transparent torification option in Tor Button, you could point a socksifier to ''start-tor-browser'' and it should work as usual.

If you are having problems, it's most likely a problem with Tor Browser / Tor Button's proxy settings. In Tor Browser open the pseudo url &quot;''about:config''&quot; and search for &quot;''network.proxy''&quot; and check if these settings are sane.

= Tor Browser in Whonix 0.5.6 =

== Introduction ==

The regular Tor Browser Bundle and Tor Browser in Whonix slightly differ. Tor Browser has been slightly modified by Whonix to work behind the Whonix-Gateway. The network and browser fingerprint however, is the same.

Tor Browser's internal update check mechanism is untouched and works fine. Default homepage is untouched and still https://check.torproject.org.

== New Identity Button ==

Note that, if you are using the Tor Browser, which comes with Whonix, that the New Identity button of Tor Button is defunct (greyed out). This is because Tor Button can not access Tor's control port. Due to Whonix Technical [[Design]], Tor Browser and Tor are isolated from each other, which means there is no way to fix this without loosing the added security by Whonix.

When using the regular Tor Browser Bundle (not Whonix!), the New Identity button unlinks your old identity, changes your circuit (exit relay IP) and creates a fresh identity.

As a workaround close Tor Browser, change your circuit with [[Tor Controller|Arm]] and start Tor Browser again.

This isn't a big issue, since the New Identity button isn't perfect yet anyway, there are open bugs.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=needs_information&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=keywords&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;keywords=tbb-linkability tbb-linkability] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=needs_revision&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=keywords&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;keywords=tbb-fingerprinting tbb-fingerprinting].&lt;/ref&gt;

(New Identity Button will be fixed in Whonix {{Whonix6}} and above.)

== Whonix Proxy Settings / user.js ==

When running &lt;code&gt;torbrowser -update&lt;/code&gt;, the update script creates a &lt;code&gt;user.js&lt;/code&gt; file, for example &lt;code&gt;~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile/user.js&lt;/code&gt;. User.js is used to override some Tor Button defaults, namely the SocksProxy settings and other minor misc settings. &lt;ref&gt;If you are curious which these are in details, or for reviewers or auditors, see [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/stable/whonix_workstation/usr/local/bin/torbrowser torbrowser script and user.js on github].&lt;/ref&gt; See also the [[Stream_Isolation#Limited_workarounds_for_Tor_Browser|Tor Browser sub chapter]] on the Stream Isolation page.

== More than one Tor Browser in Whonix ==

For better isolation of different identities. For advanced users. Moved to the [[Advanced_Security_Guide#More_than_one_Tor_Browser_in_Whonix|Advanced Security Guide]].

= Manually updating Tor Browser =
(1) Go to https://www.torproject.org/ and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/ and download the Tor Browser Bundle for Linux 32 bit. Store it in ''/home/user/''.

(2) Read https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en and learn about gpg verification.

(3) Go to https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en and/or http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/docs/signing-keys.html.en to get the gpg keys.

(4) Verify the Tor Browser Bundle download.

(5) Go into ''/home/user/'' with the file manger. (Dolphin)

(6) If you still have the old version of TBB opened (because you are probably reading this from the old TBB), close it. (copy the next steps to Kwrite if necessary)

(7) Rename your old TBB /home/user/tor-browser_en-US to something else.

(8) Extract the Tor Browser Bundle. Right click on the downloaded archive -&gt; extract -&gt; extract archive here.

(9) In case you downloaded another version than ''en-US'', rename the tor-browser_''lang'' folder to ''tor-browser_en-US''. This is important, because the paths in the following script are hardcoded.

(10) Go into the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US'' folder.

(11) Delete ''start-tor-browser'' or move it to the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/Docs'' folder.

(12) Create a new file within the ''/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/'' folder called ''start-tor-browser'' with the following content.

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash
## Whonix Tor Browser start script

export TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1
    
cd ~
~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile
    
## End of Whonix Tor Browser start script
&lt;/pre&gt;

(13) Make the ''start-tor-browser'' script executable. Right click on ''start-tor-browser'' -&gt; Properties -&gt; Permissions -&gt; enable the ''Is executable'' box -&gt; ok.

(14) If you want to make 100% sure you never have Tor over Tor, you must shut down Whonix-Gateway while doing the following.

(15) Delete /home/user/my_tor-browser_en-US/App/tor.

(16) If there is '''no''' green Vidalia icon in the task bar, everything is fine.

(17) Start Tor Browser and run

&lt;pre&gt;ps aux | grep tor&lt;/pre&gt;

If you see something like.

&lt;pre&gt;109 /usr/sbin/tor&lt;/pre&gt;

Or.

&lt;pre&gt;/home/user/my_tor-browser_en-US/App/tor&lt;/pre&gt;

Something went wrong and you're running Tor over Tor, which is recommended against.

(18) If the tests results are as expected, everything went fine.

(19) Don't forget to restart Whonix-Gateway, if you shut it down in step (13).

(20) Done.

= More than one Tor Browser in Whonix =
'''WARNING: &quot;More than one Tor Browser in Whonix&quot; instructions have not been updated for TBB 3.x yet!'''

As the [[Warning]] page stated, [[Warning#Whonix_doesn.27t_magically_separate_your_different_contextual_identities | Whonix doesn't magically separate your different contextual identities]] and since Tor Browser and Tor Button do not yet solve this, for further separation of identities you could use [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]], which would be more secure.

Alternatively, less secure than Multiple Whonix-Workstations, you could start multiple instances of Tor Browser and run them through different SocksPorts. The instructions in the [[Manually Updating Tor Browser]] article need minimal changes.

Instead of

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash
## Whonix Tor Browser start script

~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile

## End of Whonix Tor Browser start script
&lt;/pre&gt;

Use

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash
## Whonix Tor Browser start script

## Adjust the path!
~/tor-browser_2/App/Firefox/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_2/Data/profile -no-remote

## End of Whonix Tor Browser start script
&lt;/pre&gt;

Only {{Code2|-no-remote}} was added to the start script. Otherwise Tor Browser would connect to the already running Tor Browser and this isn't what you want. And don't forget to adjust the path to the other Tor Browser.

You also have to use a different SocksPort, see [[Tor_Browser#Change.2FRemove_Proxy_Settings|Change/Remove Proxy Settings]]. (See [[Stream Isolation]] page for explanation why you should use different SocksPorts.)

= Trusting the key =
== Download the key from multiple sources ==
A simple technique to increase the trust you can put in the Whonix signing key would be to download it several times, from several locations, several computers, possibly several countries, etc.

You could also use this technique to compare keys downloaded by your friends or other people you trust.

Downloading the key from the same server only lowers the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack for a part of the route. The following figure illustrates that best:

&lt;pre&gt;
user &lt;-&gt; user ISP &lt;-&gt; internet &lt;-&gt; sourceforge.net ISP &lt;-&gt; sourceforge.net server
MITM less likely for this route |  no help for this route
&lt;/pre&gt;

For this reasons adrelanos' homepage, which describes and contains adrelanos' OpenPGP key is mirrored at six different places. Download adrelanos' key from all those places and store it as ''adrelanos1.asc'', ''adrelanos2.asc'', ''adrelanos3.asc'', etc.

1. [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/adrelanos.mediawiki adrelanos' homepage on github]; ([https://raw.github.com/Whonix/Whonix/master/adrelanos.asc key download])

Github.com is accessible over SSL. &lt;ref name=ssl&gt; See [[SSL]] for comments on SSL (in)security.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/code/ci/b5e205ccb19a11e901124fe7f101fcb0c71b0c8c/tree/adrelanos.asc adrelanos' key page on sourceforge]; ([https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/code/ci/b5e205ccb19a11e901124fe7f101fcb0c71b0c8c/tree/adrelanos.asc?format=raw key download])

SSL available for users logged into sourceforge.net. &lt;ref name=ssl&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

3. [https://gitorious.org/whonix/whonix/blobs/master/adrelanos.mediawiki adrelanos' homepage on gitorious]; ([https://gitorious.org/whonix/whonix/blobs/raw/master/adrelanos.asc key download])

Gitorious.org is accessible over SSL. &lt;ref name=ssl /&gt;

4. [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/proper adrelanos' homepage on torproject.org wiki]

SSL available. &lt;ref name=ssl /&gt; Anyone can edit the torproject.org wiki and exchange content with malicious one. Therefore check the history feature. Obviously, I do trust Tor and torproject.org. My wiki account &quot;''proper''&quot; should be genuine, therefore changes by &quot;''proper''&quot; should be legit.

5. [https://savannah.gnu.org/people/viewgpg.php?user_id=89289 adrelanos OpenPGP key mirror on savannah.gnu.org profile page]

SSL available. &lt;ref name=ssl /&gt; The following command is recommended to enforce downloading the key over SSL:

&lt;pre&gt;
## Not forced through Tor, unless you are using Whonix, torsocks or similar.
curl --tlsv1 --proto =https --output adrelanos.asc.4 https://savannah.gnu.org/people/viewgpg.php?user_id=89289
&lt;/pre&gt;

6. adrelanos' OpenPGP key mirror on OpenPGP keyserver

No SSL. Should really be only used as a mirror.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Not forced through Tor, unless you are using Whonix, torsocks or similar.
gpg --keyserver x-hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA
&lt;/pre&gt;

7. adrelanos' OpenPGP key in Whonix 6 and above

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --import /usr/share/whonix/keys/whonix-keys.d/adrelanos.asc
&lt;/pre&gt;

Verify:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg --recv-key 916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA&lt;/pre&gt;
Should show.

&lt;pre&gt;
pub   4096R/2EEACCDA 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
      Key fingerprint = 916B 8D99 C38E AF5E 8ADC  7A2A 8D66 066A 2EEA CCDA
uid                 [ unknown] Patrick Schleizer &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;
sub   4096R/0x3B1E6942CE998547 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]

sub   4096R/0xCB8D50BB77BB3C48 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Each time you re-import the key from a different source:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --import adrelanos.asc 
gpg --import adrelanos1.asc 
gpg --import adrelanos2.asc 
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

It should always show:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg: key 2EEACCDA: &quot;Patrick Schleizer &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;&quot; not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

And:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --fingerprint
&lt;/pre&gt;

Should always show the same fingerprint and only contain: (Besides keys you imported knowingly earlier, perhaps your friends keys.)

&lt;pre&gt;
pub   4096R/0x8D66066A2EEACCDA 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
      Key fingerprint = 916B 8D99 C38E AF5E 8ADC  7A2A 8D66 066A 2EEA CCDA
uid                 [ unknown] Patrick Schleizer &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;
sub   4096R/0x3B1E6942CE998547 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
sub   4096R/0x10FDAC53119B3FD6 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
sub   4096R/0xCB8D50BB77BB3C48 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Unless the new key is signed with the old key, something fishy is going on.

= Whonix 7 OLD Known Issues =
=== Connection Issues - Tor stops working after an Upgrade and needs a Workaround === &lt;!--T:98--&gt;
When upgrading to Tor 0.2.4.19-1~d79.jessie+1 (using sudo apt-get dist-upgrade), your Tor connection may go down. There is a temporary workaround.

&lt;!--T:74--&gt;
Open /etc/default/tor.

&lt;!--T:75--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
## If you are using a graphical Whonix-Gateway, use:
kdesudo kate /etc/default/tor

&lt;!--T:76--&gt;
## Or alternatively, if you are using a terminal-only Whonix-Gateway, use:
sudo nano /etc/default/tor
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--T:77--&gt;
Scroll down, near bottom comment in (by removing the # in front of it).

&lt;!--T:78--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
USE_AA_EXEC=&quot;no&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--T:79--&gt;
Then try:

&lt;!--T:80--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service tor restart
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--T:81--&gt;
You should keep that in mind and undo that change when Whonix or Tor fixes that bug. We'll keep you posted. (See [[Download#Stay_tuned]] and [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_install_latest_security_updates_on_all_systems]].)

&lt;!--T:82--&gt;
Forum help thread:
[[Special:AWCforum/st/id287/new_tor_and_debian_updates_today....html]]

=== Virtual Box Shared Folder Issues === &lt;!--T:57--&gt;
Shared Folders aren’t working with the latest Linux kernel. (This is a Debian/Virtual Box issue, not caused by Whonix. Has already been reported to upstream by a Debian user.)

&lt;!--T:58--&gt;
Possible workarounds, more information, etc. can be found in the Whonix User Help Forum discussion thread:
[[Special:AWCforum/st/id261/VirtualBox_shared_directories_on....html]]

=== Tor Browser Starter (Whonix) === &lt;!--T:84--&gt;
After manually upgrading Tor Browser (see above)... To start Tor Browser, got to your /home/user/tor-browser_en-US folder and double click start-tor-browser. Or type in terminal (Konsole).

&lt;!--T:85--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
/home/user/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Tor Browser Updater (Whonix) === &lt;!--T:83--&gt;
Currently broken due to changes by torproject.org. You have to [[Manually Updating Tor Browser|manually update Tor Browser]] in meanwhile.

&lt;!--T:56--&gt;
Forum help thread:
[[Special:AWCforum/st/id262/updating_TOR_browser_error...html]]

=== Enigmail Encryption === &lt;!--T:59--&gt;
When using OpenPGP encryption in Icedove / Enigmail you might get &quot;encryption command failed&quot;.

&lt;!--T:60--&gt;
Icedove has been updated in Debian Testing in meanwhile. Upgrade it.

&lt;!--T:61--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--T:62--&gt;
You should then install enigmail as usual: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install enigmail
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Defunct Desktop Shortcuts === &lt;!--T:90--&gt;
The desktop shortcuts Tor Browser, Contribute, Forum, Documentation, Donate won't work until there is an upgrade of Whonix. Please manually visit these pages. How to start Tor Browser has already been explained above.

=== Whonix-Gateway: Err: http://deb.torproject.org tor-0.2.4.x-jessie/main i386 Packages 404 Not Found ===
'''Short answer''': &lt;br /&gt;
Update and upgrade your underlying Debian system (Whonix is a derivative of Debian).
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--T:87--&gt;
See also [[Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_install_latest_security_updates_on_all_systems]]. This bug will be fixed with next Whonix upgrade (will take some time). No other action strictly required for now.

&lt;!--T:88--&gt;
'''Long answer''': &lt;br /&gt;
This is because torproject deprecated that repository. That was to be expected. The repository we're using now is already preconfigured (in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list).

&lt;!--T:89--&gt;
Taking action isn't important at this stage. You can comment it out (by putting a # in front of it) in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list if you want. ({{Code|kdesudo kate /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list}} for graphical Whonix-Gateway or {{Code|sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list}} for terminal-only Whonix-Gateway) If you don't do it, it will be auto fixed with next upgrade of Whonix.


=== apt-get Hash Sum mismatch ===
If you get a hash sum mismatch when updating through sudo apt-get update then deleting the package lists should solve it. A hash sum mismatch can look like:

&lt;pre&gt;
W: Failed to fetch http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/contrib/i18n/Translation-enIndex  Hash Sum mismatch
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--T:94--&gt;
To delete the package lists, run:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo rm -fR /var/lib/apt/lists/*
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--T:95--&gt;
To make sure everything works like it should, update your package lists and upgrade your distro. Chances are that your previous update/upgrade attempts have failed due to the mismatch.

&lt;!--T:96--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--T:97--&gt;
(Source &lt;ref&gt;http://askubuntu.com/questions/41605/trouble-downloading-updates-due-to-hash-sum-mismatch-error&lt;/ref&gt;)

=== There is no public key available for the following key IDs ===
The message &quot;{{Code2|There is no public key available for the following key IDs}}&quot; is not necessarily an error. It might be just a warning/information.

&lt;!--T:105--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
...
Reading package lists... Done
...
W: There is no public key available for the following key IDs:
9C131AD3713AAEEF
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--T:106--&gt;
Check the exit code of apt-get.

&lt;!--T:107--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
echo $?
0
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--T:108--&gt;
When it's 0, there is no problem. This is due to key transition, because Whonix's repository is currently signed with the old and the new signing key.

= Reasons for Staying Anonymous Developer =
Security and trust shouldn't depend on showing a face:

* [https://tails.boum.org/forum/Who_is_behind_Tails__63__ Tails] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EnyCggbX w])

= KVM =
=== Convert ===
Converting is only required if you want to use the stable version of Whonix. No longer required for testers-only versions, see: &lt;br /&gt;
https://www.whonix.org/blog/category/testers-wanted/

1. Extract the downloaded Whonix ova images to obtain the VMDK virtual storage files.

&lt;pre&gt;
tar -xvf ~/Whonix.ova
&lt;/pre&gt;

As of now, VMDK files cannot be directly used by KVM or converted to a file type supported by KVM.

&lt;pre&gt;
VBoxManage clonehd --format VDI vmdk_file vdi_file
&lt;/pre&gt;

(You need to adjust the names vmdk_file and vdi_file.)

2. Use qemu-img to convert the vdi to qcow2. Why qcow2? Because it supports snapshotting, which is very useful for reverting Whonix-Workstation to a known clean state. You must not revert gateway snapshots of the gateway vm as that will change your guard nodes which is not good for anonymity. This would increase your chances of having a rogue guard node and exit.

&lt;pre&gt;
qemu-img convert -p -O qcow2 ~/whonix.vdi ~/whonix.qcow2
&lt;/pre&gt;

= System Requirements =
*** Lucid has been reported, not to work. Since it's only supported until 2013-04 it won't be fixed.

= Download and Verification =

The recommended way to verify the Debian Signing key is to use the [[OpenPGP|web of trust]], which is more secure, but not available to everyone.

This chapter documents an alternative and supplementary way to verify the Debian Signing key using an existing installation such as Ubuntu, which is already trusted, for example because you bought it from a reseller or got it from a friend who verified it.

We'll be using a 32-bit network installation (netinst) CD for the following examples but you can use other forms (CD, DVD) and architectures (x86-64) if desired.

'''Should work for Debian and any Debian derivative.'''

(1) Go to the [http://cdimage.debian.org/ Debian Download Page]. Example, the [http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/release/current/i386/iso-cd/ Debian Stable (Wheezy) i386 folder]. 

(2) Download.

* SHA512SUMS
* SHA512SUMS.sign 
* debian-7.4.0-i386-netinst.iso 

(3) Install the debian-keyring package, which contains the signing key. This is because the [http://www.debian.org/CD/verify Debian Verify] instructions are not accessible over SSL, neither the debian-keyring package can be downloaded over SSL. Downloading the debian-keyring package from the repository, let's apt-get verify its integrity.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install debian-keyring
&lt;/pre&gt;

(4) Open a terminal and get into the folder where you downloaded SHA512SUMS and SHA512SUMS.sign (and debian-7.4.0-i386-netinst.iso ).

(5) Verify the SHA512SUMS file.

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-role-keys.gpg --verify SHA512SUMS.sign
&lt;/pre&gt;

(6) Must show.

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg: Good signature
&lt;/pre&gt;

Otherwise something is wrong.

This might be followed by a warning saying:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
&lt;/pre&gt;

This doesn't alter the validity of the signature according to the key you downloaded. This warning rather has to do with the trust that you put in key.

(7) Done.

= Install =
'''UNFINISHED!'''

From usability perspective, [http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/06/13/why-you-should-always-have-a-network-connection-when-installing-debian/ you should always have a network connection when installing Debian].

From security perspective, [http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch3.en.html#s3.3 you should not plug to the Internet until ready].

You may have noticed, the default desktop environment for Whonix's Virtual Machines is KDE. (You could change that.) It doesn't matter, which desktop environment you are going to use for Debian. The default desktop environment of Debian is GNOME. If you are already accustomed to Whonix (KDE), you could also use KDE for your Debian host as well (not a must).

&lt;pre&gt;
##Installing KDE, LXDE or Xfce this way works if you are using a DVD image or network installation (but not with CD images)

Debian boot menu -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; Alternative Desktop Environments -&gt;
Feel free to choose:
- KDE
- LXDE
- Xfce
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's also possible to install another desktop environment after installing or to switch from one to another.

If you are wondering what the &quot;default&quot;, &quot;notebook&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; packages are about, see [http://wiki.debian.org/tasksel tasksel].

Check open ports.

&lt;pre&gt;
su
netstat -anltp | grep &quot;LISTEN&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Must should be none, i.e no reply.

Remove services, which open ports. &lt;ref&gt;For documentation purposes I made a Debian installation and installed as much services with taskel as possible, while having a network connection. (Simulating user misunderstanding.) A Debian default installation with default settings does not install all those packages.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
su
apt-get remove dovecot-core openbsd-inetd bind9 samba cups apache2 postgres* 
apt-get remove exim4 exim4-daemon-light rpcbind openssh-server apache2.2-bin
apt-get autoremove
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check open ports again.

&lt;pre&gt;
su
netstat -anltp | grep &quot;LISTEN&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Must should be none, i.e no reply.

= Security =

[http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch12.en.html Quote]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Is Debian more secure than X?''

''A system is only as secure as its administrator is capable of making it. Debian's default installation of services aims to be secure, but may not be as paranoid as some other operating systems which install all services disabled by default.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am not sure if they are referring to running services after installing them or having no services running (open ports) after a default installation with default settings. Debian doesn't do the latter, which is a pity.

Don't participate in popularity contest.

|description=How is Data Mining on the Web technically done? Overview of Data Collection Techniques.
}}
= Data Collection Techniques =

Some of the actual techniques employed by the data miners on the Web are briefly introduced below.

== Cookies ==

Cookies are used to identify and remember a web surfer. Without cookies, certain services would be complicated or impossible to implement. If a user requests a page from a webserver, it cannot readily match requests of previous pages requested from this server to that same user: HTTP is a stateless protocol.

Nevertheless, some services require a sort of memory. Shopping portals are an example: a server has to remember what goods were placed into the virtual shopping cart. This &quot;memory&quot; is usually written in the form of cookies, i.e. small text files which are being sent to you by the server upon every page request. When your browser contacts the server again, it also automatically sends back the cookie stored earlier. The server thereby allocates the right shopping cart to you.

But cookies can also be abused to track your steps on the Internet. This works exceptionally well with web portals (e.g. Yahoo) and search engines (e.g. Google), for you use these a lot in order to reach other websites. With cookies, a web host can record large parts of your surfing behavior over a span of years and easily relate it to you as a person with your &quot;accumulated&quot; profile data. Most Internet users have collected hundreds of cookies from various websites on their PC without their knowledge. The following example shows you just a small amount of cookies you get if you request ''www.nytimes.com'':

[[Image:cookies_nytimes.png|frame|none|alt=|Cookies set by nytimes.com]]

Websites embedding several external ad and tracking services are not unusual and are becoming increasingly common. A [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1898390 study by University of California, Berkeley] done in 2011 analyzed the top 100 websites and found 5,675 cookies. Of these, 4,914 cookies were set by third parties, i.e. not by the website the user visited intentionally. While surfing on these 100 websites, data was transmitted to 600 servers with the help of those cookies.

Modern browsers usually integrate an optional function to block cookies, but it has to be activated by the user first. In [[Tor Browser]] (which comes with Whonix) it has been activated by default, and in the future, more functions to administrate your cookie collection and preferences may be available.

== Evercookies ==

More than 80% of users disapprove of tracking while surfing the web. Many surfers use browser settings which prevent long-term tracking. Therefore, ad and tracking networks are moving on to use more sophisticated methods to distinguish each user.

* Flash-Cookies (LSOs) have been deployed for the last several years to recover deleted cookies with the same identification properties. Clearspring Technologies, Inc. had been using this technique successfully (until it got sued in 2010) and boasts of its precise data collection of 200 million Internet users.
* In a [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1898390 study of the University of California, Berkeley] the methods of Space Pencil, Inc., aka KISSmetrics, were exposed which, in addition to cookies and flash cookies, used cache cookies via ETags, DOMStorage and IE-userData in order to distinguish each user. KISSmetrics got sued as well and is going to dispense with using Etags. It is also going to respect the [http://donottrack.us/ &quot;Do Not Track&quot;] HTTP header.
* The tracking service [http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/ywa/documentation/install_guide/ig_get_started.html Yahoo! Web Analytics] is making claims about being able to set cookies on 99.9% of the users. This [http://smorgasbork.com/component/content/article/84-a-study-of-internet-users-cookie-and-javascript-settings indicates] that [http://www.truststc.org/reu/10/Reports/GomezG,YalajuJ_paper.pdf cookie-generating JavaScript] and/or Flash cookies are deployed.
* Samy Kamkar shows further possible methods to mark Internet users individually in his article, [http://samy.pl/evercookie/ &quot;evercookie - never forget&quot;].

[[Tor Browser]] (which comes with Whonix) resists evercookies.

== Active Web Contents ==

Web content accessible by browser plugins such as Flash, Java, ActiveX and Silverlight renders the Web more dynamic and colorful but also more dangerous, for they allow websites to execute code on your PC. If executed, these plugins are able to read many details about your computer and network configuration and send it to a remote server. By certain techniques, they can also read and edit files on your machine and in an extreme case even gain complete control over it.

Especially beware of signed Java applets: by accepting its signature, and by extension the applet, the visited webserver automatically receives all user rights on your machine. In particular, it may then read your [[#IP address]], your [[#MAC Address]] and even hard disk contents. It does not help to only surf websites you deem trustworthy either. This concept is outdated since nowadays even numerous large and authentic websites are being hacked and filled with malicious code. Only blocking, deactivating, and removing these plugins provide real security.

In Whonix, learning the IP address wouldn't give an adversary any meaningful results. It's either a local IP address shared among all Whonix users or the IP of a Tor exit relay, which is safe as well. The [[#MAC Address]] is a virtual one which is shared among all Whonix users as well, and is therefore meaningless. Active content, although it couldn't reveal your real [[#IP address]], is deactivated in Tor Browser by default. See [[Browser Plugins]] for a detailed anonymity, security, and privacy discussion of browser plugins in Whonix.

== JavaScript ==

The browser is a bit better protected against attacks on your privacy using ''JavaScript'' (&quot;scripts&quot;, &quot;active scripting&quot;) than against those using the aforementioned plugins. It, too it is not completely safe, though. Do not confuse JavaScript with ''Java'' or the ''active Java plugin'', respectively, which is a completely different thing despite the similar name (see above).

It is possible to compromise the browser or operating system using software exploits or a maliciously-crafted website. An attacker can, for example, inject malicious JavaScript code by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting Cross Site Scripting] and thus try phishing for login creditials, bank accounts or other sensitive data.

Using JavaScript, it is possible for web masters to access lots of information about your browser, your desktop settings, and your hardware. All this information may be accumulated into an individual fingerprint of a particular user. A user may be recognized by this fingerprint. The anonymity test [http://ip-check.info/?lang=en ip-check.info] shows '''only some examples''' of values which may be gathered (JavaScript needs to be enabled). It demonstrates the labeling of users by JavaScript, too (same effect as cookies).

[https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=7319 ip-check.info returns some false values and confuses TBB users]

&lt;s&gt;Therefore, we recommend you only activate JavaScript if needed and to block it by default.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;font size=-3&gt;However, there are fingerprinting concerns about disabling JavaScript. See [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024224.html Tor Browser disabling Javascript anonymity set reduction]&lt;/font&gt;

Conclusion: You should not surf the Internet without a well secured browser, as your PC is otherwise in danger of being exploited quite soon. Instead of configuring the browser yourself, which takes quite some experience and is prone to error, you may use [[Tor Browser]] (which comes with Whonix). It is a secured version of Mozilla Firefox that not only blocks most dangerous technologies by default but additionally is equipped with further ample security mechanisms. Most websites will still be reachable. YouTube videos and videos of other such portals which are rendered by Flash may be downloaded with special software and then viewed with a video player. Websites which demand usage of active plugins should be avoided if at all possible; otherwise see [[Browser Plugins]].

== Fingerprinting of Browser (HTTP) Header ==

With every request for a webpage, browsers send information within the framework of the HTTP protocol that can be analyzed by the visited site: language, browser name and version, operating system and version, supported character sets, files, codecs and the last visited webpage. Sending these headers is usually not necessary for rendering websites, but it can be exploited for reidentifying, profiling, and analyzing websurfers. The EFF's [http://panopticlick.eff.org Panopticlick] project demonstrated browser fingerprinting. Most surfers are traceable by a unique browser fingerprint.

Of late, different filter applications and services have been developed that allow hiding or changing problematic browser headers (e.g. Privoxy). Unfortunately, these applications cannot filter encrypted connections: once you load a presumably &quot;secure&quot; website (HTTPS) all filtering fails. Plus, these programs allow every user to define the header data himself. But setting an individual browser type in itself is what renders you perfectly trackable. [TorBrowser] always sends the same profile for encrypted connections too. This guarantees that websites may at most realize that it is a Tor Browser user visiting; it will not be able to tell who the user is or what the user is visiting.

Fingerprinting defense isn't perfect yet in any browser. There are still open bugs. &lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;(See [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=needs_information&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=keywords&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;keywords=tbb-linkability tbb-linkability] and [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=needs_revision&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=keywords&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;keywords=tbb-fingerprinting tbb-fingerprinting].)&lt;/font&gt;

== Browser History and Cache ==

A [http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/lerner/papers/ccs10-jsc.pdf publication from the University of California] provides an analysis of the top 50,000 websites. 1% of these websites collect information about web surfers via history sniffing. Using malicious JavaScript code and CSS hacks, information about previously visited websites were collected. Webmasters who are not familiar with sniffing technologies can use services like Tealium or Beencounter for real-time history sniffing.

Collected information is not only used for advertisements. It can be used for de-anonymisation of surfers too. A [http://www.iseclab.org/papers/sonda-TR.pdf publication from Isec] shows one possible way. Using the browser history the visited groups of the social network site Xing were collected. Because there are generally no two people who are members of the exact same set of groups in a social network, it was possible to get the real names and e-mail addresses of the users.

By certain trickery, websites can tell which websites are saved in your browser history. For this, the visited website embeds special formatting commands (CSS Stylesheets) that contain external links &quot;of interest&quot; on the pages you visit. If you have visited one of the external websites before, your browser will react by executing a command defined in the format, e.g. download a small picture from the website. The website can thereby largely guess the contents of your browser history.

From the contents of your browser cache one can conclude already cached, thus previously visited, websites. Together with every website an ETag is sent by the server and stored in the browser cache. If the website was called again, the Etag is sent first to ask for changes. This tag may contain a unique user ID. [http://www.kissmetrics.com/ KISSmetrics] was using ETags in this way to identify visitors of some TOP100 websites.

Additionally, the time required for loading a website changes when part of it is already in the browser cache. By subtle placement of the images on the website, the server can analyze the cache one by one.

At the moment, there is no reliable protection against the analysis of browser histories apart from deactivating this feature, which has been made the default in Tor Browser.

Unlike deactivating your browser history, deactivating your cache would have tremendous effect on your surfing speed, which is why we don't recommend it. In Tor Browser a protective mechanism has been integrated instead which bypasses the cache for third party content. Also, the cache is deleted automatically when you close the browser. A website can thus only gain information about itself, nt about other websites.

== Webbugs and Banner Ads ==

Very likely, you will find one or more [[#cookies]] in your browser from data miners such as [http://www.doubleclick.com/ doubleclick.com], [http://www.advertisement.com/ advertisement.com] or [http://www.google.com Google], although you may have never even visited their websites. This is due to the fact that these enterprises use, on other web sites, a simple trick to nevertheless plant cookies on you and watch your browsing: ''Webbugs''.

&quot;Webbugs&quot; are usually pictures of 1 pixel by 1 pixel which are therefore invisible to the viewer. However, they can also be coded into banner ads embedded in a website. The website contains a picture (webbug) that is loaded from another server running a statistics service (such as Doubleclick or Google Analytics). Thereby the statistics service may set or edit a cookie in your browser unnoticeably. The browser will then send this cookie back to the statistics service with every new request for a site where any webbug of this service is embedded. If the service is used on many different websites, it can now track large parts of your browsing session. If the owner of the statistics service moreover collaborates with the owner of your preferred search engine, he gets an almost complete picture of your Internet activities.

The privacy functions of most current browsers of simply rejecting cookies and/or deleting them upon browser shutdown do not achieve optimal protection from web bugs.

&lt;s&gt;To prevent session tracking, all cookies should be blocked by default if possible and only allowed in if needed for the duration of the session. Tor Browser is therefore preconfigured to deny all cookies but allow single websites at the expense of two mouse clicks. We recommend allowing cookies only on a temporary basis, so that they will be automatically blocked again after the session.&lt;/s&gt;

Another nasty feature of webbugs is, that they send, besides cookies, also your [[#IP address]] to the statistics service upon request. Even with a very good browser configuration, including switching off cookies and using webbug filters, you are never able to reliably prevent this. The only effective methods of protection against this are anonymisation services like Tor.

== TCP Timestamps ==

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a session-layer protocol for transferring data between computers. It is necessary for using Internet protocols like http (WWW), smtp (E-Mail) and ftp. When your computer sends a request for a web site, for example, this data is sent within many small TCP packets. Besides that request data, a TCP packet also contains some optional information fields in the header (metadata). One of those optional fields is the TCP timestamp. The value of this timestamp is proportional to the current time of your computer and is incremented according to your computer's internal clock.

The timestamp may be used by the client and/or server machine for performance metrics and optimization. However, an Internet server may recognize and track your computer by observing those timestamps: By measuring the clock skew of the timestamps, it may calculate an [http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/yoshi/papers/PDF/ individual clock skew profile] for your computer. Moreover, it may estimate the time when your machine was last booted. These tricks work even if you have otherwise perfectly anonymised your Internet connections.

If you are using Whonix, however, you are protected against being observed this way. The clock in Whonix-Workstation does not match your clock on the host and the clock in Whonix-Workstation is set securely by [[Dev/TimeSync|sdwdate]] over https, which will result in slightly different results compared to using the more accurate NTP.

If you are using Tor, you are also being protected against being profiled in another way: The Tor relays automatically replace your potentially insecure TCP packets with their own.

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt; [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8169 source 1: Tor trac #8169 replace TCP timestamp] [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorFAQ#DoesTorresistremotephysicaldevicefingerprinting source 2: Tor wiki FAQ] &lt;/font&gt;

== IP Address ==

The IP address is given to you by your provider on dialing into the Internet. The provider usually saves it for months or even years together with your customer data and your online time. It is your distinct identifier on the Internet which is sent along whenever you make a direct connection to any Internet service. The IP address tells the server where to send his response. As long as your IP does not change, it is easy to monitor when and what website you have contacted. The IP also reveals your provider, your location (many times) and sometimes (in case of a company or computer center) even what terminal you are on. In many cases, an IP address relates directly to one person.

All that your IP-address is revealing:

* Your current whereabouts

The country and the city/region where you are. With the help of databases [http://www.netop.org/services/ip-geolocation free of charge] or [http://www.maxmind.com/app/ip-location with costs] even districts and office buildings can be identified. This is called geolocation.

* Your Internet-provider

Personal data can be retrieved using your provider.

* Your access technology

With the help of databases one can find out whether you are using, for instance, DSL, a modem or a mobile device to surf the Web.

* Your company / your authority

In the case where you are surfing from within the network of a company or an authority, its name can be find out.

Some of the information that is given away by your IP or browser can be reviewed on [http://ip-check.info/?lang=en ip-check.info].

While the traces mentioned so far can be blurred without any special services needed, the same cannot be said about your IP address. That is why Tor has been developed: In order to blur any connection between your IP and the websites you visit. Whonix connects to the service Tor network. &lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;[https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en How Tor works]&lt;/font&gt;

== MAC Address ==

The MAC address (MAC=Media-Access-Control, sometimes also called ''Ethernet-ID'', ''Airport-ID'' or ''physical address'') is the hardware address of each individual network device. Each computer may have several of such physical or virtual network devices (bound to a cable ''(LAN)'', wireless ''(WLAN)'', mobile ''(GPRS, UMTS)'', virtual ''(VPS)'', ...). The MAC address serves as a unique identifier for the respective device in a local area network. On the Internet, it is neither used nor transmitted. Also, your access provider may only see it if your computer is not connected to the Internet over a router, but directly, for example by a modem. You may moreover [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC-Adresse change the MAC address yourself].

There is an extra chapter about the [[Pre Install Advice#MAC Address|MAC address later in documentation in the Pre Install Advice]].

|description=Control Port Filter Proxy - filtering dangerous Tor Control Port commands - Design Documentation
}}

= Control Port Filter Proxy =
== Introduction ==
Tor's control port has at least one, in context of Whonix, dangerous feature. Its &quot;GETINFO address&quot; and the answer to this request will be the real external IP of the Tor client. This can not be limited any other way, since the feature request [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8369 Option to limit information Tor's control port discloses] against Tor has not been implemented. By the way, this Tor control port feature makes also a [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/BridgeFirewall Bridge Firewall] impossible. Therefore before Whonix {{Whonix6}}, Whonix-Workstation had no access to Tor's control port. This was because, Whonix-Workstation is not supposed to have an way of finding out its own external IP address.

Before Whonix {{Whonix6}}, this also broke Tor Button's New Identity feature, which essentially sends &quot;SIGNAL NEWNYM&quot; to Tor's control port. While Tor Button's New Identity is still the only feature that was not available when using Tor Browser in Whonix, Tor Button in future will get more and more dependent on Tor's control port.

TBB (since version 3 alpha) [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6546#comment:33 by default performs its own control port verification]. It checks using Tor's control port(!), that the socks port Tor reports, is the same one as Tor Browser is configured to use. If it fails, and it would fail in Whonix 0.5.6, Tor Button would look like disabled and show a failure message.

In future, Tor Button will likely also use something like [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3652 &quot;GETINFO clockskew&quot;]. TBB developer [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8032 rejected] the idea of not adding the statement &quot;require no access to Tor's control port&quot; to TBB's design.

Therefore all requirements, Whonix-Workstation having no way of finding its own external IP address, joining Tor Browser's fingerprint for Whonix users, having no access for Whonix-Workstation to Tor's control port with Tor Buttons new requirement to have access to Tor's control port contradicted itself.

Control Port Filter Proxy has been implemented as a solution. It gives Whonix-Workstation access to a limited selection of Tor's control port commands, using white listing (not blacklisting). For example, it allows &quot;SIGNAL NEWNYM&quot; to make Tor Buttons New Identity feature available for users who use Tor Browser in Whonix-Workstation.

Therefore when Control Port Filter Proxy gets asked 'GETINFO net/listeners/socks', it lies, and answers '250-net/listeners/socks=&quot;127.0.0.1:9150&quot;'. This makes Tor Button happy and therefore it shows a &quot;Congratulations!&quot; (success) welcome page on its default homepage about:tor and not the failure page, which would confuse users. Since bug [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9224 TorButton about:tor fails when using additional socks listeners] has been fixed by Tor Tor Project, it that lie wouldn't be necessary anymore. &lt;font size=-3&gt;We're keeping it, because it is not necessary for Tor Button get a full list of all ports Tor is listening on. If an attacker compromised Whonix-Workstation, hiding that list has an advantage. The attacker can probe what ports are available to that Whonix-Workstation, but if the user added extra ports not available to the compromised Whonix-Workstation (only available to another Whonix-Workstation listening on another IP), at least those remain secret. (This is a bit theoretical, because a compromised Whonix-Workstation can spoof it's LAN IP and most likely very few users are using ARP spoofing defenses. Should we add ARP spoofing defenses by default at some point, we at least don't have to worry about this point.)&lt;/font&gt;

For eventual further Tor control port access requirements by Tor Button, the configuration file of accepted commands has to be extended. If Tor Button would ever ask for anything which violates Whonix's design (Whonix-Workstation has no way of finding out its own external IP address in particular), such as &quot;GETINFO address&quot;, for example if Tor Button wanted to ensure, that the user isn't using its own external IP address, a new lie would have to be added to the Control Port Filter Proxy script. In case many more lies are required, lies should go into the config file as well, for now, hard coding is sufficient.

Forum discussion, [[Special:AWCforum/st/id201|Disable Tor Control Port Proxy by default]].

== Whonix-Workstation ==
Tor Browser points to Tor control port 127.0.0.1:9151 by default (no changes by Whonix).

Whonix sets appropriate environment variables in /etc/profile.d/ for control port (9151), control port ip (127.0.0.1) and control port password &quot;password&quot;. The latter is not really in use, its just to make Tor Button happy, because it doesn't default to some password. Tor Button sends it, but its ignored by Control Port Filter Proxy.

rinetd redirects 127.0.0.1:9151 to Whonix-Gateway 192.168.0.10:9052.

== Whonix-Gateway ==
Control Port Filter proxy listens on 127.0.0.1 port 9052, filters (white list) incoming control port messages and forwards them to the real Tor Control Port listening in 127.0.0.1:9051. Control Port Filter Proxy itself uses cookies authentication to authenticate Tor's control port. The latter is not important, since Whonix-Gateway's only purpose is running Tor, its not a multi user operating system, and if it were compromised, cookie authentication wouldn't be of help anymore either.

== Attack Surface ==
* tcpserver (ucspi-tcp debian package) (The server handling connections.)
* /bin/bash (The script interpreter.)
* controlportfilt and cpf-tcpserver (The scripts.)

== Attack Scenarios ==
Once Whonix-Workstation has been compromised, the adversary could continuously and/or using a pattern, send white listed commands to Tor. At the moment, only NEWNYM would be of interest. When the adversary is also an ISP level adversary, the adversary might be able to see the pattern being produced. This however isn't a big risk, since once Whonix-Workstation is compromised, more powerful attacks are available - An adversary could also use &quot;Morse Code&quot;, i.e. limit the victims traffic for a few seconds to zero or close to zero, then push the traffic to its maximum. 

More worrying is the extended attack surface. See &quot;Attack Surface&quot; above. I am not aware of anyone having audited tcpserver or /bin/bash for vulnerabilities. Please add this information if you know more.

sudo service controlportfiltd restart

tail -f /var/log/controlportfilt.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

To get a list of Control Port commands, Tor Button uses:
get into Tor Button source code

&lt;pre&gt;
grep -r torbutton_send_ctrl_cmd *
&lt;/pre&gt;

|description=Anonymous Chat, IRC, XMPP. Pidgin/TorChat in Whonix without Tor over Tor.
}}
= General Safety Advice =

Recommended knowledge: [[DoNot#Do_not_mix_Modes_of_Anonymity.21|Modes of Anonymity]].

Most of instant messenger protocols are unsafe from a privacy point of view. This is not a Whonix specific problem. It is a general problem with instant messengers.

Pidgin (see chapter below) supports most protocols.

[[Warning#Tor_exit_nodes_can_eavesdrop_on_communications|Tor Exit Node eavesdropping]] can happen if no encryption to the server is enabled. Some protocols have encryption disabled by default, some do not support encryption at all. See also [https://tails.boum.org/todo/Pidgin_Protocol_Review/ Overview about Pidgin protocols and their encryption features]&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.is/8w0Zf&lt;/ref&gt;. If encryption to the server is enabled, the Tor Exit Node can no longer eavesdrop. One problem solved, another problem remains unsolved.

The server could still gather interesting information.

* Account names
* Buddy list (list of contacts)
* Log login dates and times
* Timestamp of messages
* Who communicates with whom
** If the recipient knows the sender and the recipient uses a non-anonymous account or was ever logged in without Tor, this can be used as a hint who the sender is.
* Content of messages - Can be prevented using end-to-end encryption. This is covered in the OTR encryption chapter below.

Jabber/XMPP is a server-federation-based protocol designed with openness in mind. Its security depends on you making good use of OTR as you can never be sure if servers are properly encrypted between each other. Privacy with Jabber is limited, as it is visible to various kinds of attackers who your account is talking to. Tor only helps to pseudonymize your account and hide your current location, but your social graph may still expose your identity.

Systems which do not require a server by design, i.e. serverless instant messengers are likely better from a privacy point of view. Such systems are TorChat (below) and RetroShare (below).

For IRC inside Whonix-Workstation, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ident Ident Protocol] is automatically blocked because Whonix-Workstation is firewalled.
The [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc] contains general IRC safety techniques and other tips.

= TorChat =

== General ==
Whonix developer adrelanos is very curious about [https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat TorChat]. The concept of having a serverless and fully encrypted instant messenger based on Tor hidden services is marvelous.

Unfortunately, adrelanos can't recommend TorChat for Whonix. This is because the TorChat developer does currently not respond to other people, see [https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/issues TorChat issues]. Adrelanos believes communication and support is crucial for anonymity related projects.

TorChat ships it's own copy of Tor, sets up a hidden service and the messenger on the host. Whonix runs Tor and applications on different machines. Tor on Whonix-Gateway and applications on Whonix-Workstation. Since it's recommended to [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.|prevent Tor over Tor scenarios]], the autostart of Tor has been disabled in /etc/default/tor in Whonix 7 and above. (When you install TorChat in Whonix-Workstation, it will also pull Tor as a dependency, but Tor won't be started.)

TorChat won't be installed in Whonix by default because, see footnote...&lt;ref&gt;[[Special:AWCforum/st/id203/#post_884]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== HowTo ==

=== Installation ===
'''EXPERIMENTAL''' Experimental as in it is difficult to install. Only use it in case you trust TorChat. There shouldn't be any anonymity leaks and it should be as safe as other hidden services in general and in Whonix.

Learn about [[Hidden Services]] in Whonix first and learn how to set up the hidden webserver. This will ease following this guide.

==== On Whonix-Gateway ====
Open your {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
&lt;/pre&gt;

And add.

&lt;pre&gt;
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/torchat/
HiddenServicePort 11009 192.168.0.11:11009
&lt;/pre&gt;

Save.

Reload Tor.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service tor reload
&lt;/pre&gt;

Get your onion address.

&lt;pre&gt;
## You need root to do that
sudo su
&lt;/pre&gt;

Find out your .onion hostname.

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /var/lib/tor/torchat/hostname
&lt;/pre&gt;

Backup your key, if you want to ever restore it one another machine, a newer Whonix-Workstation or after hdd failure. If you don't care to get a new TorChat ID, you can skip this step. (Your have to manually do this! If you want to do this, the file you would have to backup is {{Code2|/var/lib/tor/torchat/private_key}}.

==== On Whonix-Workstation ====
{{mbox
| type       = notice
| image      = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text       = No worries, this won't result in [[DoNot#Prevent_Tor_over_Tor_scenarios.|Tor over Tor]] thanks to Whonix's [[Dev/Dummy_Tor|Dummy Tor]] implementation on Whonix-Workstation which prevents this.
}}

Update your package lists.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
&lt;/pre&gt;

Install TorChat.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install torchat
&lt;/pre&gt;

Open the {{Code2|torchat.ini}} which is in the hidden folder {{Code2|/home/user/.torchat/torchat.ini}}. The folder {{Code2|~/.torchat/Tor}} can be ignored.

Look for the following line.

&lt;pre&gt;
own_hostname = &lt;your onion hostname without the .onion ending&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Replace it with your onion hostname. For example if your onion hostname is {{Code2|idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion}} replace it enter {{Code2|idnxcnkne4qt76tg}}, so it looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
own_hostname = idnxcnkne4qt76tg
&lt;/pre&gt;

Save.

=== Starting ===

'''NOTE''' It can take a while until a Tor hidden service becomes reachable for the first time. Wait at least a few minutes before you believe it doesn't work.

Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; Internet -&gt; TorChat Instant Messenger

=== Uninstall ===

If you want to remove it. On Whonix-Workstation.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get remove torchat
&lt;/pre&gt;

And undo the changes in {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} on Whonix-Gateway.

&lt;pre&gt;
nano /etc/tor/torrc
&lt;/pre&gt;

Reload Tor.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service tor reload
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Debugging ===

In case it won't work for you.

Test if Tor is reachable on 192.168.0.10:9119.

&lt;pre&gt;
/usr/bin/wget 192.168.0.10:9119
&lt;/pre&gt;

If it says.

&lt;pre&gt;
--2013-02-13 13:49:47--  http://192.168.0.10:9119/
Connecting to 192.168.0.10:9119... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 501 Tor is not an HTTP Proxy
2013-02-13 13:49:47 ERROR 501: Tor is not an HTTP Proxy.
&lt;/pre&gt;

It means, it's fine and the port is reachable.

Run torchat in a Terminal.

&lt;pre&gt;
torchat
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following output is an example, how it looks when everything is fine.

&lt;pre&gt;
~ $ torchat
(0) [config,470,main] python version 2.7.3 (default, Jan  2 2013, 16:53:07) [GCC 4.7.2]
(0) [config,477,main] script directory is /usr/share/torchat
(0) [config,478,main] data directory is /home/user/.torchat
./tor.sh: 6: ./tor.sh: tor: not found
(0) [tc_client,2083,startPortableTor] very strange: portable tor started but hostname could not be read
(0) [tc_client,2084,startPortableTor] will use section [tor] and not [tor_portable]
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are using [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]], where the Workstation has another IP than ''192.168.0.11'' you must edit the following line in torchat.ini.

&lt;pre&gt;
listen_interface = 192.168.0.11
&lt;/pre&gt;

Did the hidden webserver example from the [[Hidden Services]] page work for you? Try that first.

You also could try using the TorChat source package, which is still documented on the [[Deprecated]] page.

=== Technical Design ===

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;The [[Dev/Dummy Tor]] package prevents Tor over Tor.&lt;/font&gt;

= RetroShare =

In fact [http://retroshare.sourceforge.net RetroShare] is not an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymizer anonymizing network], it is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend friend-to-friend] (F2F) network, or optionally a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(file_sharing) darknet]. RetroShare has a very different audience and threat model.

RetroShare is in active development. Users can operate servers for themselves, but the architecture doesn't depend on them. Communications are encrypted end-to-end and provide for messaging, mail, forums, pubsub, file exchange and even telephony. The problems with RetroShare are the confused user interface, the necessity to have it run most of the time and contribute to the distributed hashtable (DHT, causing continuous CPU usage) and three relevant privacy aspects: You expose your social graph to a global passive adversary because friends connect to friends directly. Your public IP is available in the DHT, allowing to track your physical locations. And your visible user name is exposed in the TLS certificate when somebody connects to your RetroShare node.

Several of these problems can be solved by disabling the built-in DHT and hiding RetroShare behind a Tor hidden service. People who scan Tor hidden services will however still be able to connect the service and see the RetroShare user name in the self-signed certificate. This will hopefully be fixed someday by both RetroShare (the certs) and Tor (the discoverability of hidden services).

Although google search results and many people may claim otherwise, it is possible to run RetroShare through Tor, due to transparent proxying. '''Still experimental. Feel free to experiment and please share your results. Can two people, using RetroShare inside Whonix-Workstation, who only added each other, connect to each other?'''

Running RetroShare through Tor enables you, to do things, which are normally potentially dangerous, such as adding random people (from a forum), while staying anonymous. (For example, to join a RetroShare forum.) This is '''not''' a recommendation, just stating a possibility.

After adding tons of random &quot;friends&quot; from a public forum, I could connect to a very few people over TCP. &lt;ref&gt;Chance of working better ('''untested'''): [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Note, in case you are using the previous footnote, [[Security_Guide#Other_Anonymizing_Networks_over_Tor_UDP_Tunnel|Other Anonymizing Networks over Tor UDP Tunnel]] applies.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately only 5% were online. Although I can probably see only a very small portion of the network, the content of the network looks pretty interesting.

RetroShare reports Right click -&gt; DHT Details: NET WARNING No DHT; Behind NAT UNKNOWN NAT STATE MANUAL FORWARD

There still may be some privacy caveats left with RetroShare trying to communicate outside of Tor, but that doesn't matter if Whonix makes any non-Tor traffic impossible.

= Pidgin =
For instant messaging in Whonix you can install the Pidgin&lt;ref&gt;http://pidgin.im/&lt;/ref&gt; Instant Messenger. It is a multi-protocol client, so you could run MSN, ICQ, IRC, AIM, XMPP/Jabber and many other protocols at the same time, even with several instances of the same protocol.

All of these chat systems are unsafe if not used together with OTR. Even when used with OTR, expect to be exposing your social graph. Privacy hackers isolate parts of the social graph by running several accounts for groups of people on each popular server, thus avoiding the insecure XMPP federation (adding people on servers that isn't your own).

For more detailed documentation refer to the [http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Using%20Pidgin official Pidgin user guide].

You can install it using Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Terminal.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pidgin
&lt;/pre&gt;

There is also a Torchat plugin available for pidgin [https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/downloads official libpurple-torchat pidgin plugin], which could be implemented to allow p2p encrypted end-to-end communications although there is no known documentation on getting this done specifically in Whonix. It works seamless on standard pidgin/linux distro's with tor, the code is over a year without any changes/updates, hopefully because it simply works without any need for changes.

= OTR encryption =

Of course the issue of end-to-end encryption arises again. As we mentioned earlier, we have Off-the-record messaging&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr&lt;/ref&gt; (commonly called OTR) for instant messaging, and Pidgin and many other instant messengers have support for that. There are several resources on how it works and how to use it on their web site. Basically all you need to do is choose &quot;Start private conversation&quot; in the OTR menu and a key will be generated automatically if you do not have one already. After that OTR will establish a private conversation if the other end's instant messenger supports it.

If you didn't authenticate your partner with something like a shared secret there can be a man in the middle recording your chat, even if you are using the same server (the server or the TLS connection to the server may be corrupted).

OTR and other Pidgin plugins are enabled in the &quot;Tools menu -&gt; Plug-ins&quot; section. Simply check the appropriate box for enabling any plugin you want, and possibly you might also want to configure it by pressing the &quot;Configure Plug-in&quot; button. When this is done for the OTR plugin a window that can be used to manage your keys will open. The use of OTR is recommended as many instant messaging protocols normally sends your messages in plaintext. Force your friends to migrate to clients with support for OTR!

'''NOTE''': &lt;code&gt;/me&lt;/code&gt; is '''not''' encrypted when used in a OTR private conversation! Also &lt;code&gt;/msg&lt;/code&gt; in XMPP chatrooms isn't – it goes through the chatroom server!

Read also those [http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/index.php#docs various other resources about OTR].

You can install it using Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Terminal.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pidgin-otr
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Why do you need anonymity? =

As you are probably aware of, we currently find ourselves in a state of steady erosion of our freedoms and privacy, with increasing levels of mass surveillance and repression all over the world (see [http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-559597 this report from Privacy International]).

Without taking any precautions, your Internet service provider, the State, the police, and global surveillance systems like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON ECHELON] (which is '''not''' a conspiracy theory; see [http://www.fas.org/irp/program/process/rapport_echelon_en.pdf this report from the European Parliament]) can record what you do online: what you read, what you write, and with whom you communicate.

This is possible since all messages sent over the Internet contain the [[Data_Collection_Techniques#IP_Address|IP addresses]] of both the sender and receiver, much like an ordinary mail sent through the postal system contains addresses of both sender and receiver for two-way communication. IP addresses can easily be traced back to the physical location of the computers and their owners, and from that ultimately back to you.

If you do not mind this fact, then more power to you, but if you do mind, then Whonix might be just what you need.

Moreover, just like with a postcard, any information traveling on the Internet can be read by the many computers that relay them.

The Tor Project prepared a page [https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en Who uses Tor] in case you are interested.

|description=Access Whonix-Gateway Port From Host (Esoteric Documentation)
}}

= Access Whonix-Gateway Port From Host =

'''This is very esoteric and you probably don't need it!''' '''Advanced users only!'''

'''Only tested with Whonix 0.5.6. Will need changes for later versions.'''

== Example: Make port 9050 accessible from the host. ==

On the host...

In the Whonix-Gateway VM network settings. Set up Port Forwarding: within the &quot;Adapter 1&quot; tab click &quot;Advanced&quot;, then Port Forwarding. Insert a new rule as follows.

&lt;pre&gt;
Name: 9050
Protocol: TCP
Host IP: 127.0.0.1
Host Port: 9050
Guest IP: leave blank
Guest Port: 9050
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or the same as command line.

&lt;pre&gt;VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; --natpf1 &quot;9050&quot;,tcp,127.0.0.1,9050,,9050&lt;/pre&gt;

Inside Whonix-Gateway...

Add to {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
## 10.0.2.15 is usually obtained from VirtualBox's DHCP server.
## Hope this always works, otherwise you have to edit /etc/network/interfaces
## and use a static virtual LAN IP.
SocksPort 10.0.2.15:9050

## The next line is not strictly required, neat for debugging.
SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9050
&lt;/pre&gt;

Reload Tor.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service tor reload&lt;/pre&gt;

Look at {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_FLASHPROXY=1
FLASHPROXY_PORT=9050
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Debugging ==

Inside Whonix-Gateway...

Switch to clearnet user.

&lt;pre&gt;
su clearnet
## default password: changeme
&lt;/pre&gt;

Test if the port you want to make available on the host is available from inside Whonix-Workstation. (If that's not the case, something is fundamentally wrong and you need to fix this first.)

&lt;pre&gt;
## Circumventing uwt curl wrapper.
/usr/bin/curl 127.0.0.1:9050

## Circumventing uwt curl wrapper.
/usr/bin/curl 10.0.2.15:9050
&lt;/pre&gt;

It should answer &quot;Tor is not a http proxy&quot;.

== Testing ==

On the host...

&lt;pre&gt;/usr/bin/curl 127.0.0.1:9050&lt;/pre&gt;

It should answer &quot;Tor is not a http proxy&quot;. If you see that, that indicates that Tor is, which runs inside Whonix-Gateway is accessible on the host as well.

== Forwarding that port to LAN ==

On the host...

This is untested, but should work, otherwise get in contact.

You can use something like rinetd to redirect that port 127.0.0.1:9050 to a different network interface. Otherwise you could experiment with the Whonix-Gateway VM network settings.

|description=Design Notes about Whonix's Developers
}}

= About Developers =

Whonix initially has been created by (at least) three people, see [[Authorship]]. A lot other people reserve credit, as outlined on the Authorship page. Please carefully read the [[Whonix:General_disclaimer|Disclaimer]].

Documenting what Whonix does and what Whonix does not do is more a task for documenting what it does not do. Quoted from the [[About]] page: &quot;Remember, Whonix is based on Debian, KDE, VirtualBox, Tor and Tor Browser. It is nothing very special. To oversimplify it: Whonix is just a collection of configuration files. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;

The result (Whonix) creates a picture in some people's minds that Patrick Schleizer (Whonix developer) must be similar to Tor developers a genius and expert for all kinds of technical topics. The facts are quite the opposite...

Patrick Schleizer:

* Has initiated the TorBOX project, which was later renamed to Whonix. (See [[History]].)
* Initially had some help by (at least) two different people.
* Many improvements are based on reading documentation, papers, researching, stating questions, discussion, communication with the community.

What Patrick Schleizer is NOT an expert for:

* Tor source code
* Tor anonymity
* Security
* Vulnerabilities
* Exploits
* Hardening
* ...

Creating Whonix was quite simple and you'll see it yourself if you care to read the source code and technical design. There was a learning curve involved and time investment. That does NOT make me automatically an expert in all kinds of topics.

|description=Debian Packaging of Whonix Design Documentation
}}

= About Debian Packaging =

debian/control: There are separate meta packages for dependencies and recommended packages.

If we used the &quot;Recommends&quot; field for Whonix meta packages (those who pull the required Debian upstream packages for creating Whonix), we could not install them using apt-get with --install-recommends, which is apt-get's default option, because that would also install packages recommend by any dependency we install.

On the other hand, if we installed using apt-get --no-install-recommends, the packages Whonix's meta packages recommends, will not get installed.

Therefore splitting them, appeared to be the only solution. Otherwise it would install packages such as virtuoso, soprano and vlc, which are not useful '''in context of''' Whonix-Gateway.

Negative:

* No direct download links (hotlinking).
* No SSL.
* Advertisements.

Positive:

* Unlimited quota and traffic. (Although we [https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/site-support/5403/ should remove old releases from time to time].)

== Bug / Feature Request Tracker ==
Now hosted on github: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues

A bit suboptimal, since people have to create a second account just for github and it probably won't scale well enough in long term. Positive points are, that it works for many big projects such as Bitcoin and attracts a lot pull requests (for them). So let's see how that works.

== Testing infrastructure ==
Whonix is neither Microsoft with Windows nor Canonical with Ubuntu or similar. At the moment there is only one person committing new code to Whonix.

Testing infrastructure is limited to adrelanos's hardware. There is no big test laboratory, where Whonix could be tested on a variety of different machines and systems. Probably due to the web infrastructure being quite limited (not encouraging people to register and volunteer enough) and the project being quite young (since 2012), there are very few testers. On the other hand the project has no founding. Some people anonymously post comments, but due to not having a pseudonym (account name) this has limited reputation.

Let's see what happens when adrelanos calls for testing the next Whonix release.

= Old Criteria and Plan for Web Hosting =
== Requirements for Good Hosting ==
=== Requirements ===

* Some webspace and sufficient traffic.
* Needs a wiki, a forum, a blog, a mailing list.
* We can either use free project hosting or own hosting.
* Tor friendly.
* No tracking scripts. (Google analytics etc.)
* Permit to sign up and to use the page exclusively over Tor.
* A wiki on that site (media wiki). (And spoilers.) (And flagged revisions.)
* A free SSL certificate.
* All parts off the website reachable over SSL without any warnings.
** sourceforge.net does not offer that (SSL warnings).
** startssl.com offers free SSL certificates. You simply have to prove, that you have control over the domain - but that's not possible with subdomains.
* Hosting and domain.
** Censor resistant in sense of &quot;Whonix will not get deleted.&quot;
** Free - if that is possible. No one is willing to pay and in the beginning there are no donations.
* We allow guest/anonymous postings (bug report, feedback, etc.) and moderate it very non-restrictive. (Allow any critique. Only delete off topic talk such as warez.)
** It's still desired to have the less critical parts of the wiki open for guest edits.
** Where no random trolls/crackers can modify anything important.
** A wiki where guest edits are allowed only works when having a feature for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagged_revisions Flagged revisions] Sighted versions, where admins review changes and manually make the edited version the default visible page for everyone. To my knowledge, only mediawiki has such a feature.

=== Answered Questions ===

* Is there a free project hosting fulfilling all requirements?
** Last time checked, no.

=== Open Questions ===

* Q/A forum or ordinary forum?
* Mailing list can stay on sf.net?
* Blog can stay on sf.net? Integration with new website?
* Downloads must most likely stay on sourceforge.net? Because no other hoster allows such big downloads? And other means of downloading (torrent) are more complicated and more difficult to do anonymously (using TBB)?

=== Links, that may be helpful ===

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities Comparison of open source software hosting facilities]

== Ideal Hosting offers additionally... ==

* We better don't choose something based in non-free countries, such as US.
* Fully accessible by text mode browsers.
* Fully accessible without JavaScript.
* Optionally reachable by a hidden service.

= Reviewed Hosting Services =
== sourceforge.net ==
In past, all components of Whonix were hosted on sourceforge.net. Whonix still uses sourceforge.net as primary bulk file download service. Unfortunately, sourceforge does not provide direct download links (hotlinking).

The internal wiki, forum and the mailing list and download mirrors provided by sf.net provide unlimited traffic, which is very good.

The forum provided by sourceforge.net was not very well suited for Whonix. Most users are expected to post to the forums over Tor. sourceforge.net doesn't handle changing IP's very well. Registered users often had to post twice until their message got stored. And if they haven't stored their draft beforehand it was lost, which was really annoying. Positive points were, that the forum was viewable over SSL, but only for registered users. Let's say user's managed to successfully post a message, then it was still confusing because the message had to be manually moderated due to automatic spam scripts targeting Whonix forum. Sourceforges wiki was unfortunately not viewable over SSL, which was very bad.

sf.net generally provides two different categories of hosting. [http://sourceforge.net/p/allura/ Allura] with &quot;some&quot; SSL, i.e. the wiki, forum, mailing list, download mirrors on the other hand [http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Project%20web%20and%20developer%20web%20platform project web].

Project web (no SSL) has somewhat low limited traffic, but according to their support will be manually increased.

One of the major issues with sf.net is, that is does not support SSL everywhere. In past, the [[Contribute]] page contained a [[Contribute#Vote Ideas|Vote]] chapter and one of the votes users are encouraged to, was [http://sourceforge.net/apps/ideatorrent/sourceforge/ideatorrent/idea/721/ Idea #721: Allow SSL for SourceForge pages whenever possible]. Unfortunately, very few users voted.

A very strong point for sf.net is, that big files (virtual machine images) and unlimited traffic are allowed. Another strong one of course is, that sf.net allows Whonix to be hosted on sf.net.

Sourceforge.net blocks users from &quot;Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria&quot;.

Other severe usability bugs:

* [https://sourceforge.net/p/allura/tickets/5661/ Improve Support for Tor Browser; option to disable IP check]
* [https://sourceforge.net/p/allura/tickets/5662/ Prevent drafts from getting lost]
* [https://sourceforge.net/p/allura/tickets/6207/ Long content pages broken]

== Google Code ==
* Google Code blocks users from &quot;Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria&quot;.
* [http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html No file downloads.]

=== wikimedia / wikpedia ===
Last time I checked wikipedia (wikimedia) derivatives and wikia weren't Tor friendly.

== savannah ==
* https://savannah.nongnu.org (with SSL) looked promising and I don't expect them to be gone soon or to do any other stupid stuff (banning countries etc.).
* They offer homepages, for example http://www.nongnu.org/qwe/ but I haven't seen subdomains (qwe.nongnu.org) with SSL (for nongnu.org). That's the minimum requirement.
* Support direct download links (hotlinking).
* Can't provide file hosting for Whonix, because it would cause too much traffic. &lt;ref&gt;https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/savannah-hackers-public/2013-09/msg00015.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== github ==
* Already using github as main git repository.
* github.com offers [https://github.com/blog/272-github-pages sub domains], but they are not reachable over SSL. I can't believe, there are no open source project hosting services with web hosting and SSL.
* github triggers [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7084 a] [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7265 scary], [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6253 error] message. After either many pages trigger that error so it doesn't matter any more or until this message gets fixed in Tor Browser, we shouldn't use the github as issue tracker or website to avoid FUD. When that got somehow a non-problem, we could think about using github as issue tracker.
* I haven't found out how to autocreate table of contents using markdown on github, but...
* Github also [https://github.com/github/markup/ supports] mediawiki syntax.
** Seems it automatically creates a table of contents, good!
** Bug: [https://github.com/github/markup/issues/193 Mediawiki Pictures now shown in Github Wiki], unless this bug gets fixed, we could think about using the github source code hosting as website, see [https://github.com/adrelanos/testw/blob/master/README.mediawiki example].
** I haven't found out yet how to use \[\[include ref=WikiHeader\]\] for github mediawiki pages. It's an important feature for Whonix pages.
** Looks like mediawiki support is just a gimmick. More advanced formatting like font size, syntax highlighting and so on doesn't work.
* No file hosting service.

== gitorious ==
* Nice as a git mirror. [https://gitorious.org/whonix/whonix In use] as a git mirror.
* SSL for the whole page including the wiki.
* The wiki supports less features, no html (not that important) and no tables. The side bar takes too much space and leaves too less page for the wiki. The wiki is more suited for smaller documentation but not as a whole website replacement like Whonix needs.
* No file hosting service.

== self hosted hidden service ==
* Adrelanos is not willing to do it.

== free onion hosting service ==
* We could host a website on third party (free) hidden service webspace service.
* Risky, because those services can go away any time without notice. - Looks like a valid risk, two just went down. &lt;ref&gt;
* &lt;s&gt;[http://bj6sy3n7tbt3ot2f.onion OnionHosting] (DOWN)&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;Price 5 BTC of &quot;life time&quot;.&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;I think it's a legit service. The Administrator is hosting many services in onionland for a long time. - Turns out this wasn't true&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;I don't have 5 BTC to open an account.&lt;/s&gt;
* &lt;s&gt;[http://torhostg5s7pa2sn.onion/ torhost] (DOWN)&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;I don't know for how long it will stay.&lt;/s&gt;
** &lt;s&gt;I [http://p4vm6o4n4hbfqxhy.onion/ have a sponsored account], which has the same features as the fair paid account.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Can they handle the load when we release a new version? Not talking about bandwidth. Just about page views.
* Clearnet users could only access them through onion.to and tor2web.
** onion.to has a scary landing page.
** tor2web [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-February/027344.html does not yet appear in search engines]

== mirror.fsf.org ==
* http://mirror.fsf.org/
* Providing direct download links (hotlinking).
* I don't think it will be possible. They have a quite firm policy ([https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html Guidelines for Free System Distributions]) and if Debian didn't manage to fulfill it, surely Whonix can't either.
* In theory, an option could be to base Whonix on a distribution which is [https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html on their list already], but that might not be doable for technical reasons. (Questions open up, such as: Are they in sync with Debian unstable? Are they in sync with Debian testing? How long does it take until they deploy updates from security.debian.org? How up to date are their packages? How are they different from Debian?)

== seul.org ==
* Did send registration request for seul.org. They don't accept new registrations, but Roger Dingledine (surprise, surprise) said in private mail, he's seeding Tails already and would volunteer to seed Whonix, if there was an announcement mailing list or if I mailed him new releases. Doing this.

== Conclusion ==
In summary there where no open source hosting sites, which offer SSL everywhere and unlimited download of big files. An open source hosting facility providing free webspace and SSL everywhere would be much desirable, but doesn't exist.

= Hosting Services to be reviewed =
== General Questions ==
* Download traffic?
* Quota?
* Direct download links (hotlinking) possible?
* Optional: SSL downloads?

== Mirror Providers ==
There are a few lists

* http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Mirrors#MirrorProviders
* http://mirror.slitaz.org/mirrors
* http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/mirrors-rsync.html
* http://www.debian.org/distrib/archive

of mirror providers. We could contact them and ask if there were willing to provide direct download links (hotlinking) (+SSL) for Whonix.

When they are able to sponsor sourceforge, in comparison, sponsoring Whonix would be only peanuts to them. The question is, if they provide service for individual requests.

== codeplex ==
* Seem to offer direct download links. Just stored some random download links to see how long the direct link is valid.
* https://kinectmultipoint.codeplex.com/downloads/get/692328
* http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download/Release?ProjectName=kinectmultipoint&amp;DownloadId=692328&amp;FileTime=130174287196930000&amp;Build=20602

== bitbucket ==
* Seem to offer direct download links. Just stored some random download links to see how long the direct link is valid.
* https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads
* http://cdn.bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads/pypy-2.1-beta1-arm-armhf-raspbian.tar.bz2

== autistici ==
https://vpn.autistici.org could be asked, if they were willing to act as webseed.

== alioth ==
http://alioth.debian.org could be asked, if they accepted Whonix as a new project, related enough to Debian, then they might be used as webseed.

== Links, that may be helpful ==
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities Comparison of open source software hosting facilities]

== Asked ==
* http://linux.psu.ru/ linux at psu.ru
** November 2013: wants to test Whonix for a few months and then decide

* November 2013: mirror.aarnet.edu.au
** asked where their sourceforge folder is
** and if they tell us: asked if we may use them as master mirror for other mirrors

* November 2013: mirrorservice.org
** asked if we are allowed to directly download from them
** asked if we may use them as master mirror for other mirrors

Answer:

&lt;pre&gt;
We have no problem with you direct linking to us or you suggesting other
sites using us to mirror from (we offer rsync too).

But bear in mind that the data in that mirror is controlled by
SourceForge. They don't ship all files to all mirrors - each mirror
specifies how much data it can take, and they put stuff on up to that
limit based on popularity (presumably). Their delivery mechanism knows
which files are on which mirrors, so end users don't get pointed at a
mirror that doesn't contain the file they're after.

So it's possible that we may not have a complete copy of all your files,
and it may change in the future without any intervention from us.

If you're happy with that situation then go ahead and link to us.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Answer to follow up email:

&lt;pre&gt;
We don't have any upload facilities I'm afraid. We only offer downloads.

One solution is to run a private rsync server yourselves that only
certain mirrors can access. It doesn't have to be that quick.

You may find other mirrors do offer an upload facility though.
&lt;/pre&gt;

* November 2013: switch.ch
** asked for an upload account
** asked for master rsync capabilities

Answer:

&lt;pre&gt;
Dear Sir 

Thank you for your e-mail of 25th November 2013 regarding Whonix. 

Sorry, we are not interested in your offer.
&lt;/pre&gt;

|description=Overview about About Computer (In)Security
}}

= About Computer (In)Security =

A secure and trustworthy computer is a computer that only does what ''you'' (think you) tell it to.

Computers are insecure and not trustworthy and there is nothing we can do about that. Computers are &quot;universal machines&quot; (see Von Neumann, Turing). They can be instructed to do anything they can do according to the laws of physic. It's important to understand that a computer can't discern between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; instructions, bits are bits. There are two general problems:

(1) There are a lot of people who can instruct a given machine to do something (anything!), we need to trust them all, or verify everything, which is impossible

If you read or write all instructions (kernel, software, firmware) yourself, study the hardware design (so you understand what an instruction actually does) and compare that with the actual hardware and then make sure you are the only one who can access the machine and give it new instructions, you need to trust that other people only give the machine instructions to do things that you want it to do. You can tell it to accept other, external untrusted instructions in a restricted, controlled fashion (like &quot;render that html but other wise don't touch my system&quot;) but this is next to impossible to do reliably because of point 2). Otherwise you could never connect that machine to a network or transfer any input from another system to it (&quot;input&quot; and &quot;instructions&quot; has to be understood in a very broad sense, it's not just about executable code, it can as well be media files or hardware devices that are being attached).

The &quot;Trusted Computing Base&quot; (TCB) refers to all instructions and hardware used to restrict a &quot;universal machine&quot; from accepting and acting on (other) arbitrary instructions. It is used to set a certain security policy to enforce that a computer only does what these trusted instructions allow it to. &quot;Trusted&quot; simply means that we have to trust it, not that it's wise to trust it. The TCB tries to restrict what instructions can do but it consists of instructions itself. It can't restrict or police itself. Any flaw whatsoever in the TCB directly results in a compromise of the security of the system.

(2) The machines themselves and the instructions are incredibly complex

Even in an ideal world with mathematically verified hardware and software we may think we are giving instructions to do A while in reality the instructions tell it to do B, or also B. Machines can not make &quot;mistakes&quot; but they certainly can do unexpected things...

We can't give machines instructions in our language (programming language) it needs to be in machine code. The translation is so complex that we need another machine to do that for us, and to create that machine another was used and so on. This expands our chain of trust to basically all machines and humans involved to the first compiler created by an assembler which in turn was created by hand-written machine code.

Hardware is fallible, hardware failure can result in entirely unpredictable results. Cosmic rays &quot;flipping a bit&quot; or just bad memory and extreme temperatures? Look up &quot;Bit-squatting&quot; for an example. Software depends on the hardware to function perfectly, what happens if the most basic assumptions are betrayed?

Another example for complexity, side channel attacks: they are very difficult to protect against and poorly understood by most software developers. E.g. through power or CPU load analysis otherwise isolated parts outside the TCB can influence or eavesdrop on privileged encryption. In other words, determining what is part of the TCB and what is definitely not, is a very hard problem.

If that wasn't enough we also have the problem that circuit layouts, microcode and firmware of most vendors is proprietary. Part because of competition concerns, part because they are afraid of patents... In any case, this makes verification even more difficult that it already is. Further &quot;hardware&quot; (which includes firmware, i.e. software) is becoming more and more capable (#complex and dangerous). Features like Trusted Computing when used to prevent ring 0 access from the user and owner of the computer, EFI that has Internet connectivity and can update itself or Intel RMM which can grant remote access that is invisible to the user and OS combined with a less than perfect track record (e.g. see Intel related research by Invisible Things Lab) doesn't exactly spell trustworthy and 100% dependable.

Conclusion: The TCB can never really be trustworthy. The source code of every currently usable OS kernel alone is too complex and large to completely audit and make error free, not just for a single human but even for large groups like the &quot;Linux community&quot;. But let's assume we solve that (e.g. through using microkernels and formal verification): How do you make sure compiled binaries are actually doing what the source intended? Or, how can you verify that complex hardware and integrated circuits are actually built according to their intended design? For all the verification and auditing processes we are dependent on other complex computer systems that would have to be trusted unconditionally. Bootstrapping trust is a chicken and egg problem. We would have to be able to verify systems with just looking at them with our bare eyes and hands or build/verify all systems necessary to bootstrap a modern compiler and hardware development platform. This may have been possible for the first &quot;computers&quot; in the first half of the last century but not anymore.

Since there's nothing we can do about that, what else can we do then?

We need to design our systems in a way that makes it no longer necessary to trust them 100%. We only need to trust that it's good enough and that it's astronomically unlikely that multiple diverse systems are untrustworthy in the same way.

If you don't want a computer to be able to tell anyone your location or identity better make sure the computer doesn't know either... The Whonix security design in some ways mimics the security design of the Tor network itself: Don't trust any single entity to be trustworthy. We only rely on the fact that it's unlikely that all entities (nodes, computers) are compromised and colluding. To be precise, that's a goal that isn't achieved yet with Whonix alone, see [[Dev/Vision|Whonix²]]. One could also say that the actual TCB of such a &quot;system&quot; (actually multiple systems) becomes the design, arrangement and usage policy which is very well possible for every user to comprehend and verify.

This could be compared to the &quot;Air Gap&quot; used on most high security networks. They assume that the TCBs are not trustworthy and work around that using a simple and easily verifiable policy that basically eliminates the complete attack surface or hardware and software bugs and even protects against most backdoors (for example, a subverted PRNG could still result in weak crypto being exported from the trusted network where it can be recorded and &quot;cracked&quot; by an adversary. A strong pyhiscal isolation based system could then encrypt data twice on different systems using different PRNG implementations to protect against such attacks.)

[[Physical Isolation]] in the sense of Whonix is not a new idea, see [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/ftp/boyer/cli-reports/070.pdf Verifiable Computer Security and Hardware: Issues by William D. Young. September 1991 (PDF!)] page 18 for a summary. It seems like the idea was rediscovered by Whonix (independently, and we came up with the same term), to our knowledge Whonix is currently the only project following this approach in a defined way.

This is just a list. It keeps track of all documentation articles, which were forked from [https://tails.boum.org Tails]. This list will probably only be useful for myself and perhaps for the Tails developers.

Which exact version has been forked is stated inside the wiki source code in the linked articles.

For license information have a look on the linked pages and their wiki source code.

&lt;s&gt;There is an ''f'' button on the right top. The ''f'' stands for ''feed''. If you are interested in further forked articles you can subscribe to this page with your favorite RSS reader.&lt;/s&gt;

This page will only be updated if new articles have been initially forked.

If you want to stay current which changes have been made to a particular page, please subscribe to the particular page.

|description=Whonix RSS Reader Documentation
}}

= rss =

== Introduction ==

To try to explain it in layman's terms, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS rss] is http link, which you can use to get notified when a update on a website, such as a blog has been posted.

== rss Reader in Whonix ==

Whonix 0.5.5 and above comes with the rss reader, [http://offog.org/code/rawdog.html rawdog], pre-configured and for the main reason to fetch Whonix News Blog in a privacy friendly way. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Rawdog is not that user friendly, because it does not have a graphical user interface. For Whonix News Blog it should work quite well, because the configuration work can be done by Whonix developer.

A recommendation for a privacy friendly &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and user friendly rss reader is still under research. Help is welcome.

== rss to e-mail ==

Recommended knowledge:

* Introduction on this page
* [[E-Mail]]

For example [http://rssforward.com/ rssforward] (not affiliated with Whonix and neither recommended nor recommended against) is a rss to e-mail service. As time of writing there are also free rss to e-mail services. Because free services don't have a money trail it's easier to use them anonymously.

If you like to frequently read a website (ex: blog), such as the Whonix News Blog (as recommend on the Download page in the [[Download#Stay tuned|News]] chapter) and don't mind your the rss to e-mail service, mail provider knowing and who knows who else knowing, that you subscribed that blog, you could use such a service to stay on top of latest Whonix News.

For better security you could create a new e-mail address using Tor which you exclusively use only to receive notifications about website updates. Note that the mail provider could spoof the notification mails.

At the moment the safest way to read blogs is to do it manually in [[Tor Browser]] or to use a privacy friendly &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; rss reader inside Whonix. (See above.)

== rss to sms ==

There are also (free) rss to sms services, perhaps convenient, but they have to be considered even less anonymous than rss to e-mail. (See above.)

== Footnotes ==

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;

|description=Development Notes about Whonix's Download Statistics
}}

= TBB's Influence on Download Statistics =
Windows might have fewer downloaders than any statistic says, because TBB for Linux and MacOS claims, that it's Windows, which muddles the statistic.

= What does &quot;Anonymous Proxy&quot; in sourceforge.net statistics mean? =
Sourceforge support, ctsai-sf on freenode in #sourceforge said, they use GeoIP for country detection and browser agent for operating system and browser. GeoIP, according to its website&lt;ref&gt;https://www.maxmind.com/en/ipauthentication&lt;/ref&gt;, detects Anonymizer (they probably mean Tor and such), VPN and Open Proxies, so they everything into the same category of &quot;Anonymous Proxy&quot; - this is what sourceforge logs.

* Before announcing migration to whonix.org.
* [http://www.webcitation.org/6IWk5h4E9 Old design of download page] (Please ignore the &quot;Moved to https://www.whonix.org&quot; part. That snapshot has been forgotten and made later. Nevertheless it gives an impression how the old download page looked like.)
* Before using the new colored download table, which indicates, that http downloads without OpenPGP verification is the least secure method.
* After blog post announcing experimental BitTorrent downloads.&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/featureblog/2013/07/experimental-optional-whonix-bittorrent-downloads/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let's see, if after the end of this campaign, more users use OpenPGP verification
* Or at least use BitTorrent - although we don't create download statistics for the .torrent files.
* Or at least use magnet links - but we probably can not get statistics about them.

&lt;s&gt;Building full images from source code is currently broken (or at least very difficult), due to two bugs which have been recently introduced in Debian testing.

* http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734794
* http://ml.grml.org/pipermail/grml/2014-January/011547.html

It might take a while until these get fixed. It is planed to base next Whonix version on Debian stable instead of Debian testing to avoid that kind of build bugs and other bugs such as the AppArmor bug, that prevented Tor from starting.&lt;/s&gt;
}}

= Build Documentation =
== Introduction ==
This page documents how to build Whonix VirtualBox images. If you have any questions or need help, get in Contact.

It documents how to build the '''stable version''' of Whonix. Rather, if you are interested in building the testers-only version of Whonix, click [[Dev/Build_Documentation|Build Documentation]].

Knowledge assumed: basic principles of Virtualization; operation of your platform; Linux knowledge: how to install Debian and basic command line knowledge.

Only one prerequisite: you need a working internet connection.

For discussion related to the development and build process of Whonix images get
in contact.

How to use the resulting images, is documented in the [[Documentation]].

== Warning ==
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Better build in a virtual machine!''' &lt;br /&gt;''Long'':{{Code|/dev/mapper/loop0p1}} (and {{Code|/dev/nbd0}}) (used for mounting the images) is hard coded inside Whonix build scripts. Beware if you are using such devices. It may conflict with TrueCrypt. (And possibly other tools relying on {{Code|/dev/mapper/loop0p1}} (and {{Code|/dev/nbd0}}).) To avoid damage to your host system, it may be wise to build Whonix inside a Virtual Machine.
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Don't add private files to Whonix's source code folder!''' &lt;br /&gt;''Long'': Technically, it would work. Everything in whonix_gateway folder will get installed on Whonix-Gateway, whonix_workstation folder respectively, whonix_shared folder goes to both Whonix machines. This is recommended against. Those files would get managed by either the whonix-gateway-files, whonix-workstation-files or the whonix-shared-files package. When you later update Whonix debian packages, your files would get deleted by the package manager. Also adding private files to Whonix's source code folder, later contributing to Whonix's development and accidentally pushing the wrong git branch would be a disaster. Better add your private files to Whonix after building Whonix. Or add a custom build step adding your files, which then get copied from a folder outside of Whonix's source folder.
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Gnome user? Please disable device auto mounter. You can do this by running the following command.''' (If you don't know if you are a Gnome user or not, just run this command, it won't hurt.) ''Long'': &lt;ref&gt;Otherwise a file manager may be opened while building Whonix which could lead to issues.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open false
&lt;/pre&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Make sure there aren't any VMs in VirtualBox already called Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation!''' &lt;br /&gt;''Long'': &lt;ref&gt;Because the build script would fail, because it tries to create VMs either named Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Check if the [[Dev/SourceCodeIntro#OpenPGP Keys|OpenPGP public keys]] are still up to date. If you are in luck, you never have to update the keys yourself and the Whonix maintainer will keep them updated.''' &lt;br /&gt;''Long'': For better security.
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Do not try to build Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation at the same time!''' &lt;br /&gt;''Long'': Building Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation at the same time is not supported due to limitations in the build script. In other words, do not try to run {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-gateway}} and {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-workstation}} at the same time. The build would probably fail.

== Build Anonymity ==
While downloading the required tools for building Whonix your internet service provider could if he want notice that you want to build Whonix. This is especially interesting, if you want to redistribute Whonix, but still want to stay anonymous. The full story can be read in the chapter [[Build Anonymity]].

== Build Security ==
Especially, but not exclusively, if you want to distribute Whonix images, you should improve the security of your build environment.

* Build on a dedicated build system, install security updates... ([[Security Guide]])
* All installation medium&lt;ref&gt;Such as DVD or USB.&lt;/ref&gt; and all downloaded/used code must be verified (including all software on the host).
* Hashes, fingerprints in the scripts and the wiki is not to be trusted. Verify everything.
* Read [[Trust]].

== Host Preparation ==
&lt;!--
EDITORS NOTE: The following host preparation text is duplicated on 3 pages.
(1) [[Physical Isolation]]
(2) [[Dev/Build Documentation]] for VM images
(3) Whonix debian packages.
When making changes here, please consider also making changes there.
(Not using a template, because it would probably require a version specific template.)
--&gt;
* You need to build on '''Debian Testing (Jessie)'''. (How to obtain Debian safely: &lt;ref&gt;[[Debian|Debian ISO OpenPGP verification]]&lt;/ref&gt;) &lt;ref&gt;The build scripts could be adapted to run on other {{Code2|*NIX}} systems as well but currently they assume {{Code2|apt-get}} and {{Code2|grml-debootstrap}} to be available. You need about 15 GB of free space.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Build dependencies and configurations get automatically applied, so you don't have to worry about that. &lt;ref&gt;By {{Code2|[https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine]}}.))&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is recommended to set your terminal (for example Konsole) to unlimited scrollback, so you can watch the full build log.

== Building Whonix in Whonix ==
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
'''You only have to read this, if you want to build Whonix in Whonix.''' &lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested, click on Expand on the right.
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;

Building Whonix in Whonix is possible as well (if the Whonix version you are using as host is also based on Debian Testing (Jessie)). Unfortunately, apt-cacher-ng does not like Whonix's apt repository on sourceforge.net. Adrelanos already reported a bug. As long as this bug isn't fixed, you need to disable Whonix's apt repository while building Whonix. You can do this using the {{Code2|whonix_repository}} tool.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo whonix_repository --disable
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

== Introduction into Whonix Source Code ==
'''If you prefer to read and understand the source code just by reading scripts you may skip this optional chapter.'''

When you like to mess with the source code, it would probably help a lot if you at least know what {{Code|.img}}, {{Code|.vdi}}, {{Code|.vmdk}} and {{Code|.ova}} are being used for. See [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro|Source Code Introduction]].

== Preparation Steps ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

See [[Dev/Redistribution#Pre_Building|Redistribution Pre Building]].

{{Build_Documentation_Get_Source_Code}}

{{Build_Configuration}}

== VM Creation ==

Build a Whonix-Gateway virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

Eventually, if you wish to use a different build configuration for Whonix-Workstation, change the contents in your {{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} folder.

Build a Whonix-Workstation virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

The resulting {{Code2|.ova}} images can be found in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} folder.

Check if all went ok.

Please report back any issues!


If you want to build for the second time, made changes or want to build a newer version, you have to reset debian/changelog &lt;ref&gt;Otherwise the .deb packages would not get rebuild.&lt;/ref&gt; and remove (or rename) any eventually already existing Whonix-Gateway and/or Whonix-Workstation in VirtualBox. Open a terminal (such as Konsole).

Reset debian/changelog.

&lt;pre&gt;
git checkout -- debian/changelog
&lt;/pre&gt;

Delete eventually already existing Whonix-Gateway virtual machine. '''Warning''': This will delete a virtual machine named Whonix-Gateway from Virtual Box!

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --clean --tor-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

Delete eventually already existing Whonix-Workstation virtual machine. '''Warning''': This will delete a virtual machine named Whonix-Workstation from Virtual Box!

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --clean --tor-workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

From now, you have two options. If you do not wish to use different build configurations for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation (for example, if you do not wish to create a terminal-only Whonix-Gateway and a full Whonix-Workstation), you could use the {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build_both}} wrapper script to build both virtual machines at once. If you wish to use different build configurations, you must use the {{Code2|whonix_build}} script to build one after the other as described above.

== Cleanup ==
{{Build_Documentation_Cleanup}}

== Debugging ==
'''OPTIONAL''' (Only in case something goes wrong or if you want to audit or develop Whonix.)

See [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Debugging|Debugging]].

== Final Steps ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

See [[Dev/Redistribution#Post_Building|Redistribution Post Building]].

|description=Development Notes about OpenPGP Signed Website
}}

= OpenPGP Signed Website =
Has been requested in the forum.&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/6d7344a5/&lt;/ref&gt; Having an OpenPGP Signed Website would be desirable. But that would require a software, which does not exist yet.

There is [http://www.sanface.com/pgphtml.html PGPHTML: to make PGP or GPG signed web-pages], but there are licensing problems. &lt;ref&gt;Patrick Schleizer mailed &lt;code&gt;licensing at fsf dot org&lt;/code&gt; (name redacted). PGPHTML is probably not Free Software. If that were the case, it wouldn't be usable for Whonix. Adrelanos also mailed the author, but there was no response.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; Is the following license Free Software?

&gt; Is it GPL compatible?

&gt; homepage: http://www.sanface.com/pgphtml.html

&gt; source tarball: http://www.sanface.com/pgphtml.tar.gz

&gt; License text:

&gt;&gt; # pgphtml -- a perl script to make PGP signed web-pages
&gt;&gt; #
&gt;&gt; # by SANFACE Software &lt;sanface@sanface.com&gt; 19 June 2002
&gt;&gt; #
&gt;&gt; # Requires the PGP or GPG
&gt;&gt; # GPG support added by John Arundel &lt;john@splange.freeserve.co.uk&gt;
&gt;&gt; #
&gt;&gt; # Copy, use, and redistribute freely, but don't take my name off it and
&gt;&gt; # clearly mark an altered version.  Fixes and enhancements cheerfully
&gt;&gt; # accepted.
&gt;&gt; #
&gt;&gt; # This is version 4.1.

The license doesn't explicitly permit modifications, nor distribution
for a fee (even the relatively terse Expat license, sometimes
ambiguously referred to as the MIT License, explicitly states that you
have: &quot;... without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge,
publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,
...&quot;)

It also states that &quot;fixes ...  accepted&quot; in the same block as the
license text, so it is unclear if that is a part of the license or a
friendly request.

I can't speak to what was the author's intent when writing the license;
It isn't my place to say &quot;oh, the author of the license probably
meant...&quot; Therefore I would recommend contacting the author before using
the software and asking for a copy of the software under a well known
free software license.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

PGPHTML also wouldn't work as a complete solution.

* Users most likely won't copy and paste the text, so this would also require a browser addon automating the verification.
* Adversaries in position to modify website content can always mount a rollback or indefinite freeze attacks (see &lt;ref&gt;[[Dev/pdt#Definitions]]&lt;/ref&gt; for definitions of those attacks). I.e. could pick an old message/website, which was signed years ago and now contains insecure/outdated information without the user being informed about the attack. To prevent that, the client application would have to check a field similar to Valid-Until field&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2008/09/23/valid-until-field-in-release-f.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
* The website structure or link would have to be signed and verified as well.

While relying on the OpenPGP web of trust, and not the [[SSL|SSL cartel]], this could provide strong verification. On the other hand, it probably couldn't provide end-to-end encryption, SSL or .onion would be required for that.

It's an interesting idea, but outside the scope of Whonix to invent such a solution.

|description=Why does Whonix (not) use Automatic Updates? Why does Whonix (not) use a GUI Update Notifier or GUI Updater?
}}

= Automatic Updates =
== One click upgrade button for Debian packages==
Automation is very difficult due to issues introduced at a higher level (Debian and The Tor Project).

apt-get isn't good at conflict resolution with config files (the user may have installed arbitrary packages, changed their configs and then upstream may have updated the config file. dpkg will ask if the user wants to take the new or the old config file. Also other things can go wrong, such as problems with gpg verification, package lists, which are no longer {{Code|valid-until}}, general brokenness due to aborts during last action and so forth. Others dedicated projects have failed at simplification of apt-get, such as synaptic, apper&lt;ref&gt;Bugs such as apper recommends restarting while apt-get (command line) is still working.&lt;/ref&gt;, packagekit and software center. All failed at implementing this for everyone in all cases. When separate projects failed as a higher level (Linux distributions aren't user friendly themselves in the first place), there is nothing I could fix in Whonix at a lower level.

== Unattended upgrades in background for Debian packages ==
Reasons for Automatic Updates:

* Better usability.

Reasons against Automatic Updates:

* Apparently mysterious &lt;ref name=mysterious&gt;to those who don't know that automatic updates are enabled by default; would result in questions such as this: [[Special:AWCforum/st/id178/Weird_traffic_display_in_arm.html]]&lt;/ref&gt; system load.
* Apparently mysterious &lt;ref name=mysterious /&gt; network load.
* Some people may be on different kinds of internet connections. Sometimes they may use a connection with unlimited quota and want to postpone updating.
* If Debian's update mechanism ever gets compromised &lt;ref&gt;If a malicious package was uploaded to Debian's APT repository or if there was a critical bug in apt-get.&lt;/ref&gt;, then it would make sense for users to read [[whonixcheck|Whonix News]] before manually updating.
* [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/Dev/ArchivedDiscussion/SECURITY#SECURITYAutomaticUpdatesREJECTED Old discussion]
* If the user is using Debian a host operating system or connecting to the same mirror,
[[DoNot#Do_not_connect_to_any_server_anonymously_and_non-anonymously_at_the_same_time.21]] applies. (Since using stream isolation, in worst case, as far as I can see, the server only knows what packages you wanted to download, if that happens.)

Needs Research:

* What happens when a stale mirror is detected? Will the user be informed?
* Stale mirror attack not of concern, since exit relays change anyway?
* Are times when &quot;apt-get update&quot; is run randomized to prevent a clear network fingerprint? If not, this needs a custom implementation/diverting some scripts.
* Are times when &quot;apt-get dist-upgrade&quot; is run randomized to prevent a clear network fingerprint? If not, this needs a custom implementation/diverting some scripts.
* What are the reasons why distributions such as Debian/Ubuntu/Qubes OS are not using automatic updates by default?

Non-issues:

* The Tor Project did not ask us, not to download updates over Tor, see FAQ: [[FAQ#You_should_not_waste_the_Tor_network.27s_bandwith_by_downloading_operating_system_updates_over_Tor.21|You should not waste the Tor network's bandwith by downloading operating system updates over Tor!]]

Forum discussion:

== Auto Upgrading Tor Browser ==
For the Tor Browser version check is unreliable. Sometimes upstream messed up versions, uploads faulty version files or changes the version format. There is no way for a machine&lt;ref&gt;script&lt;/ref&gt; to determine if a new version has been released. And due to other issues (not beating the TUF threat model), the torbrowser downloader shouldn't blindly trust what the version check claims is the most recent version. Therefore the user still has to check if it's sane. Could be very well a downgrade attack at some point. If this was a text editor like application for some company who value usability more than security, I would have automated it already, but in case of Whonix that would be too insecure for my taste.

= Update Notifier / GUI Updater =
== Rejects ideas ==
=== apper (kde) package ===
&lt;s&gt;whonixcheck runs ''apt-get update''. Checks if there are updates with ''/usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check''. If there are updates, it opens ''apper --updates'', if installed. (Otherwise notifies about updates only in whonixcheck result.)&lt;/s&gt;

Apper is user friendly since there is only one big update button and does also honor proxy settings in ''/etc/apt/apt.conf'' which are required for Tor stream isolation.

Automatic update check has been disabled in ''/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic'' because the execution time would be too predictable. Whonixcheck runs at startup (non-predictable) and every day at a random time.

Apper / Synaptic subject for removal for Whonix 8, see:
https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/104

Too many bugs, too confusing:

* [[Special:AWCforum/st/id166/Gateway_update_errors.html]]
* [[Special:AWCforum/st/id42/You_have_194_updates_(can't_be_a....html]]

=== update-notifier (gnome) package ===

Overall ui is very good. Asks a confusing question to update &quot;safely&quot; and not removing packages. After updating &quot;safely&quot; it still reports updates. Open question: how to provide update-notifer in several languages? Would be all gnome language packages needed?

Would have to configure it with something like &quot;gconftool-2 --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory&quot;. Would have to

&lt;pre&gt;cp /etc/xdg/autostart/update-notifier.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/update.desktop&lt;/pre&gt;

And remove shownotin kde from /etc/xdg/autostart/update.desktop.

=== update-notifier-kde package ===
Is a bit confusing. It shows how many updates are available, but it has only one button &quot;later&quot;.

== Conclusion ==
As long there are no tools which can handle always all cases for all users, it's the best of the worse choices to teach users how to update using the CLI tools. Those always work reliably.

      <comment>suggest multiple-key strategy</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1010">==separate keys for different uses==

It appears to me that long-lived signing keys can be a risk.  The longer the key lives and the more signatures it generates, the greater the probability of a duplicate ''m'' occuring (DSA).  Also, the size of the key may have been appropriate at the time of its creation, but may not be considered secure many years later (e.g. the [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/keys.html signing keys for Putty] are only 1024 bits)  Are these realistic concerns or am I jumping at shadows?

One way to solve this:
# generate a master signing key -- distribute this key as described in the wiki.
# generate a short-lived signing key and sign it with the master key, repeat each time the key expires.
# short-lived encryption keys can be managed the same way, with the limiting case being ephemeral keys.

The master key only signs the short-lived keys, so a duplicate ''m'' is far less likely.

Maybe this is what subkeys are all about.  I'll have to dig into it more.</text>

|description=Design Documentation - How to decide which apps come with Whonix?
}}
= How to decide which apps come with Whonix? =
Overall: not killing the project for being badmouthed by The Tor Project and/or geeks due to bad decisions.
 
The following numbers are not referring to priorities, just to reference them. Just what I always had in mind, not written in stone.

# There must be a reliable upgrade path. Stuff that is in Debian is perfect.
# Upgrading must not eat up Whonix maintainer's time to keep Whonix maintainable.
# If the applications issues network activity, there must be a way to properly configure it for [[Stream Isolation]], to keep Tor's TransPort clean for the user's own stuff.
# When downloading applications, especially since downloads run over Tor, strong verification must be supported (Ex: OpenPGP, apt-get does that well.) or be so trivial that some trusted devs can audit the code for being not intentionally malicious.
# Must be Tor-safe. (Definition: must not be totally [[DoNot#Do_not_confuse_Anonymity_with_Pseudonymity.|pseudonymous]]. No major protocol leaks. For example, using Tor Browser instead of Firefox and recommending Thunderbird/TorBirdy and not some other client.)
# Must be Free Software / Open Source.
# Must not be a total security disaster.
# Must not issue network activity while the application is not in use.
# Installation/modification must not limit discussion about Whonix to the controversy of that application. (Ex: [[FAQ#Does_Whonix_modify_Tor.3F|No Tor modifications.]])
# Installing it by default in Whonix must not totally f*ck up The Tor Project.

Lesser:

* I must believe that a fair amount of users likes it.
* I must believe that it's usable by a fair amount of users.
* Mature behaving and communicative upstream, not important if the application/script is trivial and maintenance is simple.

Examples:

a) There is no BitCoin client installed by default in Whonix, because no gui client was available in Debian stable at time of release. Shipping a manually installed one by default would be nightmare, because users wouldn't know how it was installed and not update it. Updating would be left to the user. So I thought it is better if the whole process download, verification, install, upgrade notification and upgrade is up to the user.

b) There is no Email client installed by default in Whonix, because no Tor-safe client (Thunderbird + TorBirdy) was available in Debian stable at time of release.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">All traffic from Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway is routed over Tor. &lt;ref&gt;Since Whonix 0.2.1 also the Whonix-Gateway traffic is routed over Tor. This prevents telling the world that the user is a Whonix user.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;To preserve anonymity of activities the user is doing inside Whonix-Workstation, it would not be required to torify Whonix-Gateway's own traffic.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;For your interest: if you were to change DNS settings on Whonix-Gateway in {{Code|/etc/resolv.conf}}, this would only affect Whonix-Gateways's own DNS requests issued by applications using the system's default DNS resolver. Actually, by default, no applications issuing network traffic on Whonix-Gateway use the system's default DNS resolver. All applications installed by default on Whonix-Gateway issuing network traffic (apt-get, whonixcheck, timesync) are explicitly configured (or forced by uwt wrappers) to use their own Tor SocksPort (see [[Stream Isolation]]).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Whonix-Workstation's default applications are configured to use separate Tor SocksPort's (see [[Stream Isolation]]), thus not using the system's default DNS resolver. Any applications on Whonix-Workstation, not configured for stream isolation (for example {{Code|nslookup}}), will use the default DNS server configured in Whonix-Workstation in {{Code|/etc/network/interfaces}}, which is Whonix-Gateway. Those DNS requests will be redirected to Tor's DnsPort by Whonix-Gateway's firewall. (Therefore Whonix-Gateway's {{Code|/etc/resolv.conf}} does not affect Whonix-Workstation's DNS requests.&lt;/ref&gt;</text>

|description=Development Notes Secure Downloader
}}

'''Unfinished!'''

= Introduction =
Securing downloads may be better when written as a general purpose tool (not specific to Whonix).

No other projects such as Firefox or Debian support this use case.

= Metalink =
Learning C++ and adding Metalink (including OpenPGP support) into Firefox (see [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/21 Metalink], see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=331979) might be one of the simpler, yet very difficult approaches. For Firefox, gsoc may be way to get this feature in, which means that some uber geek spends 4 months full time on developing this. (While still not addressing the TUF threat model.)

= Open Questions =
* How to download and verify the host program in the first place?
* How to download the secure downloader itself in censored countries?
* How to download files in censored countries?
* Torify downloads?

= Difficulties =
Such a host program is host operating system specific, well you can write it in a cross platform language but still have to struggle with platform specific quirks.

The Tor Project never managed to get such a downloader up and running, see {{Code|Thandy}}.

|description=Archived Whonix 7 Release Announcement
}}

&lt;pre&gt;
Whonix Anonymous Operating System Version 7 Released!
&lt;/pre&gt;

Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network, Debian GNU/Linux and the principle of security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP.

Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.

Download: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Download

Users of Whonix 0.5.6 and below:

There is no upgrade path from Whonix 0.5.6 to Whonix 7. You have to manually download new Whonix images.

Call for Help:

If you know shell scripting (/bin/bash) and linux sysadmin, please join us! There are plenty of ways to make Whonix safer. We are also looking for an https direct download mirror.

Whonix 7 Changelog:

* Updated Tor to 0.2.4.

* Installed obfs3 by default. (for obfsproxy bridges)

* New Identity button on Tor Browser is now functional thanks to the Control Port Filter Proxy (#3).

* Tor Browser is now the system default browser (#86). In addition, when opening a link or an html file it will ask for confirmation to avoid accidental linking. (configurable)

* Graphical Whonix-Gateway (#26). Optionally, if you reduce Whonix-Gateway RAM to below 500 MB, let's say to 128 MB, you automagically end up with the usual non-graphical Whonix-Gateway. (configurable)

* Whonix now includes an updater. It can not be promised that you will never have to download a new image for next stable releases, but we are on that way. Interested testers may have to download images of testing releases from time to time.

* Tor networking is disabled for the first start of Whonix-Gateway. The connection wizard (whonixsetup) will automatically start to help enabling Tor or setting up bridges. This is useful for people using bridges to connect to the Tor network to hide the fact that they are using Tor.

* The current Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) Alpha, which will soon become the new TBB stable, will work out of the box in Whonix, even if you download and install it manually from torproject.org. This is useful for the case that the Whonix Tor Browser updater breaks due to changes on torproject.org. Tor over Tor situation will be automatically prevented on manual installs.

* Boot Clock Randomization.

* Time Sanity Check.

* Higher console resolution: 1024x768 (without X).

* Disabled the throw-keyids option on gpg.conf due to usability issues. Enable it manually if you need it.

* Fixed uwt. To do certain tasks such as installing the Adobe Flash plugin or running update-command-not-found you no longer need to &quot;chmod -x /usr/local/bin/curl&quot;.

* Deactivated the kgpg tray icon by default (#10), not perfect, but less confusing, since it will now start in foreground by default and no longer as tray icon (which was automatically and confusingly hidden by default).

* Downloading Tor Browser and signature from idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion instead of torproject.org for better security when run inside Whonix.

* Time Privacy wrapper (optional).

* Enable &quot;apparmor=1 security=apparmor&quot; by default (didn't enable enforce mode or add any useful profiles yet).

* Manpages for scripts which come with Whonix.

* Flexible modular .d style configuration folders: /etc/whonix.d/, /etc/whonix_firewall.d/, /etc/controlportfilt.d/.

* Moved blog to wordpress.com, better than sourceforge, because wordpress.com supports SSL, closed #23.

* Lots of other improvements and bug fixes which can be found under the git log.

|description=Development Notes of Whonix and Continuous Integration (CI)
}}

= General Note about CI Services in use for Building Whonix =
Since all CI machines I know off run Ubuntu and Whonix is based on Debian, it was required to add a few CI specific workarounds to Whonix's build script. Therefore, if a CI build works, that doesn't necessarily mean, that a Debian based build would succeed as well. So the usefulness of the results is a bit limited. Nevertheless, compatibility with CI environments is a very useful &quot;stress test&quot; for the build script. It helps early spotting most bugs, which break the build.

Since there are no free CI services supporting {{Code2|mount}} ({{Code2|device-mapper}}), there is unfortunately no CI service which could be used for building Whonix Virtual Machine images.

= CI Services in Use =
== Travis CI ==
General:

* [https://travis-ci.org/Whonix/Whonix Whonix Travis]
* [http://lint.travis-ci.org/Whonix/Whonix Whonix .travis.yaml validatior]
* We're using Travis CI to see if we can build Physically Isolated Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation.

Some more technical notes:

* Build time hard limit [http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/#Build-Timeouts 50 minutes]
* Build time inactivity limit [http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/#Build-Timeouts 10 minutes]
* Support says: The command and the URL to clone currently can't be influenced.
* These commands &quot;$ rvm use default --install --binary --fuzzy ; $ ruby --version ; $ rvm --version ; $ gem --version&quot; are not required. Support says: As for the commands listed, those can't be removed either, and they shouldn't add any significant load or time to your build.
* Support says: Regarding retaining storage, we have an APT caching service in the works, that's currently in testing. It won't be host-local, but it'll be network-local.
* Build failed log: https://api.travis-ci.org/jobs/12119447/log.txt?deansi=true - Failed due to missing device-mapper. No idea if possible to fix. - [https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1493 Opened a ticket.]
* [https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1495 impossible to start haveged daemon]
* [https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1494 very low entropy, gpg key creation takes very long]: workaround in place. &lt;ref&gt;If is CI detected... Linking {{Code|/dev/urandom}} to {{Code|/dev/random}}. In CI environment, there is usually very little entropy. Therefore gpg key creation takes very long. Since no images are deployed from CI systems, we can do this.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If image creation isn't possible, Travis CI could still be used to check if the whonix_build script works with --bare-metal switch.
* [https://www.evernote.com/shard/s32/sh/0dfcfbe1-b9a9-4f04-bcd4-6508ac4b0de0/8fa5f856cea80ed74aa824d47e3df031 stop a build button]

== drone.io ==
* &lt;html&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://drone.io/github.com/Whonix/Whonix/status.png&quot; alt=&quot;loading...&quot;&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
* Only building Whonix Debian Packages. No virtual machine images or physically isolated machines, because build timeout is too short. Only running.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo -E ./build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine
./build-steps.d/1200_create-debian-packages
&lt;/pre&gt;

* [https://drone.io/github.com/Whonix/Whonix Whonix drone.io]
* Build timeout [https://plus.google.com/111708768635110714271/posts/cYnpYJowXZD 15 minutes]?
* github web hook (activated): https://drone.io/hook?id=github.com%2FWhonix%2FWhonix

= Other CI Services not in use due to issues =
== codeship.io ==
* No root. - Asked support. - Impossible to build Whonix VM images. kpartx and mount require root.
* [https://www.codeship.io/projects/7701/builds/377197 Whonix codeship.io]

== shiningpanda-ci.com ==
* &quot;Due to our limited capacity we cannot accept all projects at once and that's why your subscription was queued. As we increase our capacity we will allow more and more open-source projects, based on a first registered, first served policy. Here is your position in the queue:&quot; 198 Whonix

== wercker.com ==
* has $WERCKER_CACHE_DIR
* gpg key creation takes very very log due to low entropy - asked support
* another issue while running grml-debootstrap

&lt;pre&gt;
/dev/mapper/control: open failed: Operation not permitted
Failure to communicate with kernel device-mapper driver.
device mapper prerequisites not met
* Error setting up loopback device.
-&gt; Failed (rc=1)

|description=Development Notes about Tor.
}}
{{forkme}}

= Tor Config Files =
== Current Implementation and Plan ==
The plan is as it follows.

* {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} holds minimal content, so we don't have to update it ever again
* Instructions in {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} say ''copy and paste from {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc.examples}}''.
* We should never update {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} because that would lead to an {{Code2|interactive dpkg conflict resolution dialog}}
&lt;ref name=dpkg-conflict-resolution-dialog&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Configuration file `/etc/tor/torrc'
 ==&gt; Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==&gt; Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : background this process to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** interfaces (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? N
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;
Because, /etc/tor/torrc comes with an out commented {{Code2|#DisableNetwork 0}} which gets commented in by {{Code2|whonixsetup}}, i.e. {{Code2|whonixsetup}} changes that line to {{Code2|DisableNetwork 0}}, which dpkg will consider as user modification.&lt;/ref&gt;, because that would be bad from an usability perspective. Such an {{Code2|interactive dpkg conflict resolution dialog}} confuses quite some users. Also from a security perspective, if the user chooses {{Code2|Y or I}} (install the package maintainer's version), the user may lose its (security) settings such for example its proxy and/or obfuscated bridges settings.
* {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc.examples}} contains configuration examples.


* Whonix's Tor settings go into {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}}.
* Users will ignore {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}}, because this file is barely advertised and barely popular.
* {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}} can be updated without any conflicts with user modifications.

== Rejected Alternatives ==
=== Only Two Config Files ===
* Using only {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}} and {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}, not using {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc.examples}}.
* And having configuration examples (instructions) in {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}}. Using a minimal {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} to tell them to look into {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}} for configuration examples.
* This is a bad idea, because users get tempted out comment things in {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}}.
* When they do this, they settings would get lost and overwritten without asking next time they update Whonix packages, because {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}} is not a configuration file (since in {{Code2|/usr}}, not {{Code2|/etc}} folder).

=== Only One Config File ===
* Using only {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}}, leaving {{Code2|/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc}} with defaults (from Debian), not using {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc.examples}}.
* Using {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} for user examples, user's own modifications and Whonxi's Tor settings.
* This is bad, because when users have edited {{Code2|/etc/tor/torrc}} and Whonix Debian Packages get updated, it will throw an {{Code2|interactive dpkg conflict resolution dialog}}&lt;ref name=dpkg-conflict-resolution-dialog /&gt;. Users might decide to keep their old config file and will miss (security) improvements.

      <comment>just wrote a bit about me on my user page describing why I'm trying to help on this project</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1134">== A Bit About Me ==

Just somebody who cares about privacy on the internet, and thinks what the NSA is doing is severely wrong, and an intrusion on the civil liberties of those of us living in the United States of America.  Hell, that's against their mission statement, and blatantly illegal for them to do.  Their mission is to be snooping on absolutely every other communication in the world, and they do that, too.  So I'm not the only one that should be pissed; if you're coming in from a non-USA site, I'm sorry that my country is treating you like you don't have human dignity, civil liberties, and standard human rights.  It seems like my country doesn't treat anyone with common human decency anymore.  Regardless, contributing to this project, in whatever small way I can, is my way to try to help make up for the massive wrongs that my government (well, the government of the UK is helping, too) is perpetrating on the rest of the world.

I wish you all the best.  Feel free to leave me feedback or ask me questions in the my discussion page.

= DNS on Whonix-Gateway =
'''Advanced users only!'''
'''Usually recommended against and neither necessary.'''

{{TorifiedGateway}}

Whonix-Workstation is configured to use various SocksPorts, DnsPort and TransPort, see also [[Stream Isolation]]. Whonix-Gateway is only configured to use various SocksPorts. A global system DNS resolver isn't required for Whonix-Gateway for anything. (Except, resolving the hostname of a proxy used in /etc/tor/torrc through Tor would be useful.)

Working. Using Whonix-Gateway's user {{Code2|clearnet}}.

|description=How to skip certain Whonix Postinst Scripts
}}

= Skipping Postinst Scripts =
'''Advanced users only!'''

Let's say for example you don't like the &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_desktopicons&lt;/code&gt; postinst script creating Desktop icons each time an update from Whonix apt repository comes.

Once you identified which postinst script you don't like, just run

&lt;pre&gt;
export WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS+=&quot; 20_sanity_checks &quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

before running &quot;&lt;code&gt;apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

Or you could add them to the &lt;code&gt;WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS&lt;/code&gt; environment variable separated by spaces to &lt;code&gt;/etc/environment&lt;/code&gt;, example.

&lt;pre&gt;
WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS=&quot;70_desktopicons 70_knetattach 70_whonix_apt_key&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

After changing &lt;code&gt;/etc/environment&lt;/code&gt;, you need to reboot.

In case this feature is of interest to you, a solution for not requiring reboot and adding them to a config file in &lt;code&gt;/etc/whonix.d&lt;/code&gt; could be easily and quickly added. Just make a feature request in that case.

{{#seo:
|description=Everything you should know about Whonix's Configuration Files.
}}

= .d style configuration folders =
Whonix's modifications provide a few modular flexible.d style configuration folders.

* {{Code|/etc/whonix.d}}
* {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d}}
* {{Code|/etc/controlportfilt.d}} (Only on Whonix-Gateway.)
* {{Code|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} (Only if you build from source code.)
* {{Code|/etc/sdwdate.d}}

We'll explain it using an example. For example, {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}} says.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Please use &quot;/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user&quot; for your custom configuration,
## which will override the defaults found here. When Whonix is updated, this 
## file may be overwritten.
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same in other words.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Instead of editing this file, please create and use the file
## &quot;/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user&quot;. When Whonix is updated, 
## &quot;/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default&quot; will be overwritten. Files in folder 
## &quot;/etc/whonix_firewall.d/&quot; are sourced in alphabetical order. Anything in 
## &quot;/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user&quot; will always override the defaults,
## allowing the user to keep their settings after updating Whonix.
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same yet in other words... Files in {{Code|.d}} folders are usually sourced in lexical order. That means, files named {{Code|30_...}} will always get overruled by files named {{Code|50_...}}.

For example, directly editing {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}} is recommended against. This is because, next time Whonix gets updated, {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}} may get new settings and improved settings. You would end up with an {{Code2|dpkg interactive conflict resolution dialog}}, which would for example look the following.

&lt;pre&gt;
Configuration file `/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default'
 ==&gt; Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==&gt; Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : background this process to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** interfaces (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? N
&lt;/pre&gt;

Modifications coming with Whonix will always fall back to reasonable defaults, if you were still using an old version. However, to prevent such conflicts in the first place, you're better off reading {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}}, leaving {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}} untouched, copying settings from {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default}} and pasting them into {{Code|/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user}}.

|description=Short and simpler instructions to build Whonix Virtual Machine Images from Source Code.
}}

= Warning =
The instruction are still in alpha phase meaning there might be errors that will cause the script to break.

Best way to get help is to make a thread in the forum.

= Build Documentation =
== Introduction ==
This page documents how to build Whonix VirtualBox images.

It documents how to build the Whonix 8.


Build prerequisites:

- working internet connection.

- system with Debian Stable (Wheezy) installed

- 25GB of free disk space


The focus here is to show the simplest way to build Whonix from source. Various security precautions such as GPG key verification are omitted.

Please read the [[Dev/Build_Documentation|full build documentation]] in order to understand the process better.

== Preparing the system for build ==

&lt;pre&gt;
## (host) login with &quot;root&quot;
root

## Add a new repository source if not already present
echo &quot;deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy main&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list

## Refresh package lists and upgrade
apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade -y

## Install &quot;sudo&quot; and git if not already installed
apt-get install sudo git -y

## Add &quot;user&quot; to &quot;sudo&quot; group
addgroup user sudo

## Reboot the system to apply the changes
shutdown -r now
&lt;/pre&gt;


== Building from source ==

&lt;pre&gt;
## (host) login with &quot;user&quot;
user

#Get source code.
git clone https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix

## Go into the git directory
cd Whonix

## Get a list of available git tags.
git tag

## Choose which version you want to build.
git checkout 8
&lt;/pre&gt;

== VM Creation ==

It is recommended that you create a log of the build process by redirecting all the output to a log file. Be aware that by doing so no build progress will appear on the screen - instead a text log file will be created in your home folder. 


Build a Whonix-Gateway virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-gateway &gt;&gt; ~/log-gateway 2&gt;&amp;1
&lt;/pre&gt;


Build a Whonix-Workstation virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-workstation &gt;&gt; ~/log-workstation 2&gt;&amp;1
&lt;/pre&gt;

The resulting {{Code2|.ova}} images can be found in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} folder.


If don't want to create a log of the build process (the build progress will then appear on screen) use the following commands. 


'''This is not recommended because if anything goes wrong during the build, it will be harder to pinpoint the exact error without the actual log file.'''


For Workstation

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-workstation 
&lt;/pre&gt;

For Gateway

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Finish == 

After a few hours (depending on your disk speed, CPU clock rate, available download bandwidth, ...) the image (either Workstation or Gateway) will be created in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} directory. This will take from 3 to 7 hours per image.

OVA image can now be used in VirtualBox.

|description=Complete and Comprehensive Instructions to build Whonix 8 Virtual Machine Images from Source Code. Including build configurations, such as 64 bit builds, Terminal-Only builds and so forth.
}}
{{forkme}}

= Build Documentation =
== Introduction ==
This page documents how to build Whonix VirtualBox images. If you have any questions or need help, get in Contact.

It documents how to build the '''testers-only version''' of Whonix. Rather, if you are interested in building the stable version of Whonix, click [[Dev/Build_Documentation|Build Documentation]].

Knowledge assumed: basic principles of Virtualization; operation of your platform; Linux knowledge: how to install Debian and basic command line knowledge.

Only one prerequisite: you need a working internet connection.

For discussion related to the development and build process of Whonix images get
in contact.

How to use the resulting images, is documented in the [[Documentation]].

== Warning ==
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Don't add private files to Whonix's source code folder!'''
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': Technically, it would work. Everything in whonix_gateway folder will get installed on Whonix-Gateway, whonix_workstation folder respectively, whonix_shared folder goes to both Whonix machines. This is recommended against. Those files would get managed by either the whonix-gateway-files, whonix-workstation-files or the whonix-shared-files package. When you later update Whonix debian packages, your files would get deleted by the package manager. Also adding private files to Whonix's source code folder, later contributing to Whonix's development and accidentally pushing the wrong git branch would be a disaster. Better add your private files to Whonix after building Whonix. Or add a custom build step adding your files, which then get copied from a folder outside of Whonix's source folder.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Gnome user? Please disable device auto mounter and the file indexing service. You can do this by running the following commands.''' (If you don't know if you are a Gnome user or not, just run this command, it won't hurt.)
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': &lt;ref&gt;Otherwise a file manager may open Whonix's chroot folder (the directory, in which the image which is currently build is mounted) while building Whonix which could lead to failing umount because the device is still busy.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Run the following command.
&lt;pre&gt;
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open false
&lt;/pre&gt;
* System Tools -&gt; Settings -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Details -&gt; Removable Media -&gt; Uncheck &quot;Never prompt or start programs on media insertion&quot;
* System Tools -&gt; Settings -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Search and Indexing -&gt; Uncheck &quot;Monitor file and directory changes&quot;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''KDE user? It is recommended to disable nepomuk.You can do this by running the following command.'''
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': &lt;ref&gt;Nepomuk indexing the whonix_binary folder wastes some time indexing.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Start menu -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Desktop Search -&gt; uncheck Enable Nepomuk Sematic Desktop -&gt; Apply
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Make sure there aren't any VMs in VirtualBox already called Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation!''' 
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': &lt;ref&gt;Because the build script would fail, because it tries to create VMs either named Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Check if the [[Dev/SourceCodeIntro#OpenPGP Keys|OpenPGP public keys]] are still up to date. If you are in luck, you never have to update the keys yourself and the Whonix maintainer will keep them updated.''' 
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': For better security.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Do not try to build Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation at the same time!'''

&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': Building Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation at the same time is not supported due to limitations in the build script. In other words, do not try to run {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-gateway}} and {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-workstation}} at the same time. The build would probably fail.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Build Anonymity ==
While downloading the required tools for building Whonix your internet service provider could if he want notice that you want to build Whonix. This is especially interesting, if you want to redistribute Whonix, but still want to stay anonymous. The full story can be read in the chapter [[Build Anonymity]].

== Build Security ==
Especially, but not exclusively, if you want to distribute Whonix images, you should improve the security of your build environment.

* Build on a dedicated build system, install security updates... ([[Security Guide]])
* All installation medium&lt;ref&gt;Such as DVD or USB.&lt;/ref&gt; and all downloaded/used code must be verified (including all software on the host).
* Hashes, fingerprints in the scripts and the wiki is not to be trusted. Verify everything.
* Read [[Trust]].

== Host Preparation ==
&lt;!--
EDITORS NOTE: The following host preparation text is duplicated on 3 pages.
(1) [[Physical Isolation]]
(2) [[Dev/Build Documentation]] for VM images
(3) Whonix debian packages.
When making changes here, please consider also making changes there.
(Not using a template, because it would probably require a version specific template.)
--&gt;
* You need to build on '''Debian &lt;u&gt;stable&lt;/u&gt; (currently: wheezy)'''. (How to obtain Debian safely: &lt;ref&gt;[[Debian|Debian ISO OpenPGP verification]]&lt;/ref&gt;) &lt;ref&gt;The build scripts could be adapted to run on other {{Code2|*NIX}} systems as well but currently they assume {{Code2|apt-get}} and {{Code2|grml-debootstrap}} to be available.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Build dependencies and configurations get automatically applied, so you don't have to worry about that. &lt;ref&gt;By {{Code2|[https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine]}}.))&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is recommended to set your terminal (for example Konsole) to unlimited scrollback, so you can watch the full build log.
* You need ~ 30 GB free disk space. When you build inside a Virtual Machine using sparse files such as VirtualBox, consider assigning 100 GB free space. (Sparse files will grow as space is actually used. Won't take up space if it's not used. Easier to have the option to use more space than growing the image later.) More info: &lt;ref&gt;~ 25 GB might suffice as well. We haven't messured that in detail yet. Less space required, if you only want to build either Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation. Less space for Whonix-Gateway required than for Whonix-Workstation.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building Whonix in Whonix ==
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
'''You only have to read this, if you want to build Whonix in Whonix.''' &lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested, click on Expand on the right.
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;

'''TODO''': Currently probably not possible, because there is no existing Whonix release based on Debian stable (currently: wheezy).

Building Whonix in Whonix is possible as well (if the Whonix version you are using as host is also based on Debian stable (currently: wheezy)). Unfortunately, apt-cacher-ng does not like Whonix's apt repository on sourceforge.net. Adrelanos already reported a bug. As long as this bug isn't fixed, you need to disable Whonix's apt repository while building Whonix. You can do this using the {{Code2|whonix_repository}} tool.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo whonix_repository --disable
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

== Introduction into Whonix Source Code ==
'''If you prefer to read and understand the source code just by reading scripts you may skip this optional chapter.'''

When you like to mess with the source code, it would probably help a lot if you at least know what {{Code|.img}}, {{Code|.vdi}}, {{Code|.vmdk}} and {{Code|.ova}} are being used for. See [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro|Source Code Introduction]].

== Preparation Steps ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

See [[Dev/Redistribution#Pre_Building|Redistribution Pre Building]].
{{Build_Documentation_Get_Source_Code}}

{{Build_Configuration}}

== VM Creation ==
&lt;!--
EDITORS NOTE:
I am not sure it is a great idea to first tell builders how to build Whonix and later how to clean up to prepare for another build. Running the cleanup steps before the creation steps may be unnecessary when running these steps for the first time, but doesn't hurt either. An important thing this does archive is creating fewer support requests and bug reports from people running these steps for the second time without remembering they have to clean up first. If you want to discuss this, please open a new discussion.
--&gt;

Open a terminal (such as Konsole).

Delete eventually already existing Whonix-Gateway virtual machine. '''Warning''': This will delete a virtual machine named Whonix-Gateway from Virtual Box!

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --clean --tor-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

Delete eventually already existing Whonix-Workstation virtual machine. '''Warning''': This will delete a virtual machine named Whonix-Workstation from Virtual Box!

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --clean --tor-workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

From now, you have two options. If you do not wish to use different build configurations for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation (for example, if you do not wish to create a terminal-only Whonix-Gateway and a full Whonix-Workstation), you could use the {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build_both}} wrapper script to build both virtual machines at once. If you wish to use different build configurations, you must use the {{Code2|whonix_build}} script to build one after the other as described below.

Build a Whonix-Gateway virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

Eventually, if you wish to use a different build configuration for Whonix-Workstation, change the contents in your {{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} folder.

Build a Whonix-Workstation virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

The resulting {{Code2|.ova}} images can be found in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} folder.

While building, you might see a few [[#Expected Build Warnings|Expected Build Warnings]].

Check if all went ok.

Please report back any issues!

== Build Verification (Optional) ==
{{Build Documentation Build Verification}}

== Cleanup ==
{{Build_Documentation_Cleanup}}

== Debugging ==
'''OPTIONAL''' (Only in case something goes wrong or if you want to audit or develop Whonix.)

See [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Debugging|Debugging]].

== Final Steps ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

= Expected Build Warnings =
&lt;pre&gt;
Can not write log, openpty() failed (/dev/pts not mounted?)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Does not affect the build. &lt;ref&gt;Nothing to worry about. Only happens because we are running commands inside chroot. If you research this &quot;issue&quot;, you'll read that it is purely cosmetic.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
[....] Your system does not have the CPU extensions required to use KVM. Not doing anything. ...[ FAIL ]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Does not affect the build. &lt;ref&gt;KVM gets installed as dependency of our build dependency libguestfs-tools. We don't need KVM for building the actual images.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
[....] Stopping VirtualBox kernel modules [ ok ].
[....] Starting VirtualBox kernel modules[....] No suitable module for running kernel found ...[ FAIL ]
invoke-rc.d: initscript virtualbox, action &quot;restart&quot; failed.
&lt;/pre&gt;
Does not affect the build. &lt;ref&gt;Only means, that VirtualBox can not be started. VirtualBox kernel modules could not be complied, because the {{Code|linux-headers-$(uname -r)}} package was not installed prior installing VirtualBox (prior starting Whonix's build script). The build script doesn't start VirtualBox, hence does not affect the build. The build script only uses {{Code|VBoxManage}} for creation of virtual machine description files and that tool doesn't need VirtualBox kernel modules.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
WARNING: The character device /dev/vboxdrv does not exist.
	 Please install the virtualbox-ose-dkms package and the appropriate
	 headers, most likely linux-headers-486.

	 You will not be able to start VMs until this problem is fixed.
&lt;/pre&gt;
Does not affect the build. &lt;ref&gt;Same as above.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
dpkg: warning: failed to open configuration file '/root/.dpkg.cfg' for reading: Permission denied
&lt;/pre&gt;
Does not affect the build. &lt;ref&gt;This happens because we are running {{Code|debuild}} as user, not root. Probably a bug in dpkg. If you research this, you'll see, there were many such bugs in dpkg.&lt;/ref&gt;

= Whonix Debian Packages =
== Which ones are safe to remove? ==
Feel free to remove the following desktop specific meta packages.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get remove whonix-shared-desktop
sudo apt-get remove whonix-shared-desktop-kde
sudo apt-get remove whonix-shared-kde-accessibility
&lt;/pre&gt;

Feel free to remove the following meta packages, which contain a list of recommended (as in useful to have, not necessary to have them for some other reason):

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get remove whonix-shared-packages-recommended
sudo apt-get remove whonix-gateway-packages-recommended
sudo apt-get remove whonix-workstation-packages-recommended
sudo apt-get remove whonix-workstation-default-applications
&lt;/pre&gt;

After removing these packages, it is recommended to run the following command, so the packages which the meta packages above installed get uninstalled.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get autoremove
&lt;/pre&gt;

== What other packages do Whonix meta packages install? ==
See {{Code2|debian/control}} in Whonix source code folder or [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/debian/control debian/control on github].

Or use for example.

&lt;pre&gt;
apt-cache show whonix-workstation-default-applications
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Which packages should never be removed? ==
Do not remove {{Code2|...-dependencies}} packages.

* whonix-shared-packages-dependencies
* whonix-gateway-packages-dependencies
* whonix-workstation-packages-dependencies

Do not remove {{Code2|...-files}} packages.

* whonix-shared-files
* whonix-gateway-files
* whonix-workstation-files

Do not remove {{Code2|...-postinst}} packages.

* whonix-shared-postinst
* whonix-gateway-postinst
* whonix-workstation-postinst

== Why is package X installed? ==

{{Header}}

= Professional Support =
Coming Soon! (~2 days)

= Free Support =
* When the Tor Browser download script is failing, use the [https://www.whonix.org/forum/ Whonix User Forum]. Since many users are affected when it breaks, there is probably already an existing topic.

* Linux/Debian related questions, are welcomed&lt;ref&gt;http://meta.unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1461/would-you-be-happy-to-welcome-whonix-gnu-linux-users-on-unix-se&lt;/ref&gt; on http://unix.stackexchange.com. Add the {{Code2|whonix}} tag&lt;ref&gt;http://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/whonix&lt;/ref&gt;, which will alert Whonix developers and followers.

* For general Tor questions not directly related to Whonix (e.g. &quot;What are end-to-end correlation attacks?&quot;), use http://tor.stackexchange.com; the [https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk tor-talk mailing list]; or [irc://irc.oftc.net/tor IRC] ([https://webirc.oftc.net:8443/?channels=Whonix Webchat])

* General questions about computer security can be discussed at http://security.stackexchange.com/

* Whonix specific Tor questions are welcomed&lt;ref&gt;http://meta.tor.stackexchange.com/questions/119/would-you-be-happy-to-welcome-whonix-gnu-linux-users-on-tor-se&lt;/ref&gt; on http://tor.stackexchange.com. Add the {{Code2|whonix}} tag&lt;ref&gt;http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/whonix&lt;/ref&gt;, which will alert Whonix developers and followers.

* For Whonix specific questions not suitable for the stackexchange Q/A format, use the [https://www.whonix.org/forum Whonix User Forum]. Or, use the &lt;html&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/whonix-users&quot;&gt;Whonix Users Mailing List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/html&gt;. 

* [irc://irc.oftc.net/whonix #Whonix on irc.oftc.net] ([https://webirc.oftc.net:8443/?channels=Whonix Webchat])

* [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues Bug Reports / Feature Requests]

* Help others, [[Contribute#Answer_Questions|subscribe]] to Whonix's support channels.

= Safety Advice =

Be careful what you say! Especially in public places that are archived! What you say may reveal information about you: 

* Location / IP Address
* Personality
* Skills, Aims, Goals
* Personal Details
* Etc.

To keep your IP address hidden, visit these places anonymously over Tor, using either the Whonix-Workstation or the [https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en Tor Browser Bundle] from The Tor Project.

To not link your questions to an existing email or OpenID, use a separate e-mail address, OpenID, and user names just for this purpose.

Be careful with the advice you are getting in public places. Get a second opinion, and do not run commands or perform steps which you do not understand.

|description=Higher Screen Resolution without installing VirtualBox guest additions
}}

= Higher Screen Resolution without installing VirtualBox guest additions =
'''This is still experimental.''' As in tested by few people. You should always be able to undo these changes. Doesn't hurt to always have a recent backup, just in case. This is an alternative to [[VirtualBox Guest Additions]], which are [[VirtualBox_Guest_Additions#Warning|recommended against]]. See also [[#Security Considerations]].

To get higher screen resolution without installing VirtualBox guest additions, create a file called, say {{Code2|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-virtualbox-monitor.conf}}.

If there's no such directory, you need to create it first:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir -p /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
kdesudo kwrite /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-virtualbox-monitor.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

With the following contents:

&lt;pre&gt;
Section &quot;Device&quot;
  Identifier &quot;VirtualBox-Device&quot;
  Option &quot;Monitor-default&quot; &quot;VirtualBox-Monitor&quot;
EndSection

Section &quot;Monitor&quot;
  Identifier &quot;VirtualBox-Monitor&quot;
  VendorName &quot;VirtualBox&quot;
  ModelName &quot;VirtualBox&quot;
  HorizSync 1.0 - 1000.0
  VertRefresh 1.0 - 1000.0
  Option &quot;MinClock&quot; &quot;1.0&quot;
  Option &quot;MaxClock&quot; &quot;10000.0&quot;
  Option &quot;Primary&quot; &quot;True&quot;
  Option &quot;PreferredMode&quot; &quot;1600x1200&quot;
EndSection

Section &quot;Screen&quot;
  Identifier &quot;MyScreen&quot;
  Device &quot;VirtualBox-Device&quot;
  Monitor &quot;VirtualBox-Monitor&quot;
EndSection
&lt;/pre&gt;

And {{Code2|restart kdm}}&lt;ref name=restart-kdm /&gt; or reboot.

This will make Whonix come up in 1600x1200 mode by default.

You can change the default mode by changing the &quot;{{Code2|PreferredMode}}&quot; option in the &quot;{{Code2|Monitor}}&quot; section. You can dynamically switch modes from the command line with &quot;{{Code2|xrandr --output default --mode [whatever]}}&quot;, and you can see a list of available modes with plain &quot;{{Code2|xrandr}}&quot;.

You can also change screen resolution using the KDE graphical user interface, go to Start Menu -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Display and Monitor. If you want some screen resolution that isn't listed there (e.g. 1440x900), you can can try the next on your host:

&lt;pre&gt;
vboxmanage setextradata &quot;VM Name&quot; &quot;CustomVideoMode1&quot; &quot;1440x900x32&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you do not see your Start Menu button anymore (because it's outside the screen), you can start Konsole and manually start System Settings by running {{Code2|systemsettings}}.

= Security Considerations =
* It [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7255 might] be better not to maximize the [[Tor Browser]] window.
* To prevent accidentally maximizing a window, it is recommend to deactivate the following option: {{Code2|KDE -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Screen Edges -&gt; Uncheck: Maximize Windows by dragging them to the top of the screen.}}
* It might also be better not to use the same screen resolution as on your host.

= Troubleshooting =
If this doesn't work for you for some reason or if you want to revert these changes, simply delete {{Code2|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-virtualbox-monitor.conf}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-virtualbox-monitor.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

And {{Code2|restart kdm}}&lt;ref name=restart-kdm&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service kdm stop
sudo service kdm start
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; or reboot.

= Technical Stuff =
The reason you can't just get higher resolutions using {{Code2|xrandr}} &quot;{{Code2|--newmode}}&quot; and &quot;{{Code2|--addmode}}&quot; without an xorg.conf file appears to be that VirtualBox isn't providing EDID information to the default VESA driver. The driver therefore makes the conservative assumption that it can't drive the &quot;monitor&quot; with the high clock rates needed for larger display sizes. The above config file tells the driver that it can use an effectively infinite range of clock rates.

&lt;u&gt;Whonix's APT Repository&lt;/u&gt; is &lt;u&gt;disabled by default&lt;/u&gt; since Whonix 7.3.3. You may enjoy this for [[Trust]] reasons. You can later update Whonix debian packages from source code if you want.

'''OPTIONAL.'''

Usually you do not have to change the build configuration. Whonix build from source code comes with safe defaults. Whonix's APT Repository will NOT be used.

The most interesting build configurations (Terminal-Only, NoDefaultApps etc.) are documented in the following chapters below.

If you are interested, click on Expand on the right.
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
If you used build configurations earlier, it might be better to delete your build configuration folder since a few example files names change changed in meanwhile.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo rm -r /etc/whonix_buildconfig.d
&lt;/pre&gt;

Alternatively, if you know what you are doing, you can of course also manually get into the {{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} folder, examine and change its contents to your linking.

{{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} is a [[Whonix_Configuration_Files|modular flexible .d style configuration folder]].

Less popular build configurations are documented in the {{Code2|buildconfig.d}} folder and on the [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Build_Configuration]] page in a less user friendly documented way.

It is recommended to copy and paste text when creating build configuration files to avoid typos. Also keep care, that your editor even when you are using copy and paste, won't capitalizes variable names which are supposed to be lower case.
&lt;/div&gt;

= Whonix APT Repository Overview =
Whonix's &lt;u&gt;developers&lt;/u&gt; APT repository likely contain untested changes. It's recommended against to use it unless you are in touch with the development team. When we are reasonably sure, that these changes won't break Whonix's update system, they may be migrated to Whonix's testers repository where a wider audience is supposed to test them.

Whonix's &lt;u&gt;testers&lt;/u&gt; APT repository is for testers-only. Even though briefly tested by Whonix developers, it may may break apt-get during upgrade. Eventually running a few manual commands are required to fix it. Making a snapshot and be prepared to roll back in case anything goes wrong is recommended. After testing by a wider audience, packages are migrated to Whonix's stable repository.

Whonix's &lt;u&gt;stable&lt;/u&gt; APT repository is recommended for most users. Even if you're not using your production system to test Whonix's testers-only packages, you're encouraged to run separate Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation, that use Whonix's testers repository. This is because, if too few people are actually testing Whonix, it might happen that changes that are migrated to Whonix's stable repository are still causing issues.

= Disable Whonix APT Repository =
== Introduction ==
For [[Trust]] reasons you may prefer not to use Whonix's APT Repository. You can still [[Dev/BuildDocumentation|update Whonix's debian packages from source code]]. It is just less convenient.

== If you have build Whonix from Source Code ==
Since Whonix version 7.3.3 if you have [[Dev/Build Documentation|build]] Whonix from source code, by default, Whonix's APT Repository does not get added. (Unless you [[Template:Build Documentation Whonix APT Repository|opted in]] using a build configuration.) You can still [[#Verify Disabled Whonix Apt Repository|verify]], that it already is disabled, though.

== If you are using the Default-Download-Version ==
If Whonix is already installed, you can disable Whonix's APT repository using the graphical Whonix Repository tool.

(Whonix 7.3.3 and above)
&lt;pre&gt;
Start Menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Whonix Repository -&gt; &quot;Deactivate Whonix Repository&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or in terminal. (Whonix 6 and above.)

&lt;pre&gt;whonix_repository --disable&lt;/pre&gt;

Feel free to [[#Verify Disabled Whonix Apt Repository|verify]] this.

== Verify Disabled Whonix Apt Repository ==
If you want to check, if disabling Whonix's apt repository was successful, you can run the following tests.

Use {{Code2|apt-key}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-key finger
&lt;/pre&gt;

It should not show any Whonix specific keys, it should not show adrelanos's OpenPGP key.

Have a look if {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list}} exists. If it doesn't exist, everything is fine.

If you are extra paranoid, see footnote. &lt;ref&gt;
The following isn't necessary, because the whonix_repository tool has never written another sources.list file other than {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list}}.

Examine your {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
&lt;/pre&gt;

It should not include Whonix's APT Repository.

Examine your {{Code2|/etc/apt/sources.list.d/}} folder as well.

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UNFINISHED!'''

= Upgrading Whonix Deb Packages from Source Code =
== Introduction ==
This assumes you are updating Whonix's debian packages while you are using Whonix.

== Prerequisites ==
Might be a good idea to create a backup and/or snapshot before trying to update.

If you haven't done already, disable Whonix's APT repository. &lt;ref&gt;[[Whonix-APT-Repository#Disable_Whonix_APT_Repository]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
whonix_repository --disable
&lt;/pre&gt;

Upgrade from Debian packages.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get --yes dist-upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Build Documentation Get Source Code}}

== Build Dependencies ==
Get all build dependencies.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine --bare-metal
&lt;/pre&gt;

Why {{Code2|--bare-metal}}? This is correct, if you want to know why, see footnote. &lt;ref&gt;Setting the BARE_METAL variable to 1 will result in installing fewer build dependencies. For example Virtual Box will not be installed. These are only required to build full images, but since we just want to create updated Whonix Debian Packages, this is unnecessary. Not much harm done when forgetting to use --bare-metal, because the user is free to remove any build dependencies later.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Create the Packages ==
&lt;pre&gt;
./build-steps.d/1200_create-debian-packages
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Upgrade Whonix Debian Packages ==
Upgrade Whonix Debian Packages without contacting a Whonix's APT Repository, using your own locally created apt package repository.

For Whonix-Gateway.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages --bare-metal --tor-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Why use &quot;--bare-metal&quot;? Technical explanation: &quot;--bare-metal&quot; in context of Whonix's source code means &quot;do it on the system currently running, i.e. do it directly on the root folder &quot;/[...]&quot;, don't do it inside &quot;vm_image/[...]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Whonix-Workstation.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages --bare-metal --tor-workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

There will be a lot debug output. &lt;ref&gt;Unless you log in as root and run &quot;export WHONIX_DEB_DEBUG=0&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

If everything went well, you will see &lt;ref&gt;Or saying Whonix-Gateway respectively&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;It won't, if you have &quot;export WHONIX_DEB_DEBUG=0&quot; set.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
########################################################################
## INFO: Successfully configured (postinst script) Whonix-Workstation. #
########################################################################
&lt;/pre&gt;

Last message will probably&lt;ref&gt;&quot;probably&quot; means, if we don't change some messages in meanwhile and forget to update this page.&lt;/ref&gt; be:

&lt;pre&gt;
+ true 'INFO: Skipping script, because BARE_METAL=1: /home/user/whonix_dot/Whonix/help-steps/unmount-img'
&lt;/pre&gt;

In case any error is caught, the script will loudly complain by echoing in a red colored error message:

&lt;pre&gt;
ERROR in ./debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages! Aborted.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Lets hope it works well. Please get in [[Support|Contact]] should there be any issues. Leave feedback if you are using this, if it worked for you, which issues you may have had, so these instructions can be updated.

== Cleanup ==

== Get Whonix Source Code ==
Install git and get Whonix's source code from the git repository.&lt;ref&gt;From https://github.com/adrelanos/Whonix and not from https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix, because only adrelanos/Whonix contains git tags of the testers-only version.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
## Install git.
sudo apt-get install git

## Get source code.
git clone https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember it's '''W'''honix, not '''w'''honix! If you are prompted for a username for github, it means you have mistyped the web address.

== Get Whonix Signing Key ==
'''This chapter is recommended for better security, but not strictly required.''' (See [[Trust]])

Get into Whonix source folder.

&lt;pre&gt;
cd Whonix
&lt;/pre&gt;

Import the key.

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --import ./whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/keys/whonix-keys.d/patrick.asc
&lt;/pre&gt;

Verify.

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --fingerprint 916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA
&lt;/pre&gt;

Should show.

&lt;pre&gt;
pub   4096R/2EEACCDA 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]
      Key fingerprint = 916B 8D99 C38E AF5E 8ADC  7A2A 8D66 066A 2EEA CCDA
uid                 [ unknown] Patrick Schleizer &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;
sub   4096R/0x3B1E6942CE998547 2014-01-16 [expires: 2015-01-16]

&lt;/pre&gt;

Only getting the signing key from one source, from the download you want to verify isn't safe. For better security, [[Whonix Signing Key|Learn about Whonix Signing Key]].

== Verify Whonix Source Code ==
'''This chapter is recommended for better security, but not strictly required.'''&lt;ref&gt;See [[Trust]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Get a list of available git tags.

Verify the tag you want to build.

&lt;pre&gt;
## ... Replace with tag you want to build.
git tag -v 8

== Choose Whonix Version ==
Git checkout, which version (or [[Dev/git|git branch]]) you want to build.

In case you want to build a specific git tag.

&lt;pre&gt;
git checkout 8
&lt;/pre&gt;

You have to replace {{Code2|8}} with the actual version you want to build. The stable version, the testers-only version or the developers version. You can learn about current versions reading [[Download#Stay_tuned|Whonix News Blogs]]. New versions are also announced on the [[Mailing_Lists#whonix-devel|whonix-devel mailing list]]. So you could alternatively check its archives. Signing up for whonix-devel is another way to get informed about new releases.&lt;noinclude&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
If you created for example a git tag &quot;8.1&quot; and want to receive Whonix News for &quot;8&quot;, apply this.

Please look into {{Code|whonix_shared/etc/whonix.d/30_whonixcheck_default}}. Look for.

&lt;pre&gt;
## Override what version whonixcheck will show in its window title and which
## Whonix News will be downloaded. Change only if you know what you are doing.
#whonix_build_version=&quot;6&quot;
#whonix_deb_package_version=&quot;2:7-debpackage1&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Create a file {{Code|whonix_shared/etc/whonix.d/50_whonixcheck_user}} and add for example. (You still have to replace &quot;7&quot; with the custom git tag you are using.

&lt;pre&gt;
whonix_build_version=&quot;7&quot;
whonix_deb_package_version=&quot;2:7-debpackage1&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

When you later update from Whonix debian packages from for example &quot;8.1&quot; to &quot;9&quot;, these settings have to be commented out.

'''OPTIONAL!'''

Advanced users could install from Current Sources (custom) instead of from Frozen Sources (default in 7.4.0 and above). Both options have security advantages and disadvantages.

&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;

CurrentSources builds are rarely tested due to lack of contributor manpower. Should work reasonable well in principle as long as no packages are removed from Debian. The worst thing that can probably happen, is that the build fails due to missing packages.

Frozen Sources:

* Whonix's build script will use http://snapshot.debian.org instead of the more popular ftp.us.debian.org.
* Snapshot.debian.org will never change, i.e. their packages and versions will remain the same forever*&lt;ref group=currentsources&gt;Besides a few rare [http://snapshot.debian.org/removal/ exceptions].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=currentsources&gt;As long the great snapshot.debian.org service lasts.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Using Frozen Sources has the advantage, that all builders end up with a very similar &lt;ref group=currentsources&gt;Timestamps, temporary files and who knows what else (open research question) differ.&lt;/ref&gt; image. This gives builders more confidence, that they have ended up with an intact image.
* Are a precondition &lt;ref group=currentsources&gt;Actually, at least in theory, not a unsolvable precondition. But verifying an image against Debian's repository after building is a sinkhole. (Too many symlinks and auto generated files. - Help welcome!) Creating similar images because building from Frozen Sources seems to require only realistic implementation effort.&lt;/ref&gt; for some day providing the [[Comparison_with_Others#Verifiable_Builds|Verifiable Builds]] security feature.
* It follows, when building a fresh image it will contain outdated packages. (You can upgrade after booting for the first time.)
* Package downloads are still verified, but we have to ignore the [http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2008/09/23/valid-until-field-in-release-f.html valid-until] field. Which means, a man-in-the-middle attack capable adversary could feed you with packages even older than configured in the version of Whonix you are building. Any packages which were ever signed with the APT repository signing key of that codename&lt;ref group=currentsources&gt;Codename as in Testing, Wheezy, Jessie.&lt;/ref&gt;. You might not like that and therefore prefer building from Current Sources.
* At some point, for example if remotely exploitable vulnerabilities are found in the apt-get version (defined by Frozen Sources) it may be dangerous to continue building that version.
* We should compare our images with each other to ensure no man-in-the-middle attach has happened while building Whonix. [Before we can do this, Verifiable Builds need to be implemented. (Help welcome!)]

Current Debian APT repository:

* Packages and versions may change over time. Packages may be removed, replaced with others, versions get security other other updates.
* Build script may break the older the Whonix source code version release becomes. (Break as in the build won't finish - not as in creating images containing bugs.)
* Each builder ends up with an individual image.
* Valid-until field gets verified.

If you prefer to build from Current Sources, please use the following instructions.

Create {{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} folder.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir --parents /etc/whonix_buildconfig.d
&lt;/pre&gt;

Create {{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d/50_no_default_apps}} build config file.

&lt;pre&gt;

'''Advanced users only!'''

The following instructions are useful, if you have a backup of Whonix .vmdk hard disk images but want to restore them. This could be the case if your VM settings file is damaged or missing for some reason or if you only made a backup of the .vmdk files.

In case you want to use other operating systems behind Whonix-Gateway, other than the default Whonix-Workstation, then rather read the [[Other Operating Systems]] page.

      <comment>Need a widescreen vertical.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="796">This works but it makes it HUGE. Way bigger than 1600x1200 it seems. My monitor resolution is set to 1920x1080 and I still have to scroll the VM window to see it all. Changing the &quot;1600x1200&quot; to something else doesn't seem to have any effect. Do you have another way to set it smaller? 1024x768 or even 1280x720 would be perfect. Thanks!

UPDATE: I can change resolutions from 1600x1200 now within the Display Settings - but looks like I need a widescreen and that's not available. I want to place the VM on the secondary monitor which has a max res of 1366x768. At this res, the VM window at 1024x768 is a good width, but just a little off the screen vertically...have to scroll down to get to everything. What I really need is that 720 vertical. Any way to do this? Either 1024x720 or 1280x720?</text>

= If Whonix had a DHCP server running on eth1 on Whonix-Gateway... =

Advantages:

* setting up [[Multiple Whonix-Workstations]] would be simpler
* using [[Other Operating Systems]] would be simpler

Disadvantages:

* Higher attack surface due to DHCP?

Needs research:

* Does DHCP have some feature which a compromised Whonix-Workstation could abuse? Does DHCP have a feature such as &quot;tell me the IP of your upstream router&quot;?

= If Whonix has a DHCP client running on eth0 on Whonix-Workstation... =

Disadvantages:

* Needs research: Some users with little knowledge only download Whonix-Workstation and set its network settings to DHCP. ([[Special:AWCforum/st/id240/#post_1143|example]]) Accepting any IP from DHCP would allow them to non-anonymously use Whonix-Workstation easily. We would have to add some protection not accepting an IP from Virtual Box NAT, if that is possible.
* Needs research: Configuration of [[Hidden Services]] could become more difficult, because these need a fixed internal IP?

'''ADVANCED USERS ONLY!'''

[[Image:hauke_laging_gepruefter_artikel.en.png|400px|link=http://www.openpgp-schulungen.de/fuer/webautoren/|[http://www.hauke-laging.de/ Hauke Laging]'s clearsigned version of this text can be found here: [[OpenPGP_Certified]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The [http://www.openpgp-schulungen.de/fuer/webautoren/ certification] image ([https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File:Hauke_laging_gepruefter_artikel.en.png hauke_laging_gepruefter_artikel.en.png]) is copyrighted by [http://www.hauke-laging.de/ Hauke Laging].|thumb]]

= Introduction =
The high level overview of this concept is as follows:

# Shut down your every day operating system. Boot your air gapped operating system. You can boot a Live DVD or an operating system installed on external media such as USB (recommendation: use full disk encryption). Using a separate physical hardware is better than just booting another operating system, but still, using another operating system is better than nothing.
# By default GPG creates a signing key as your main key (your identity) and one encryption subkey (how you receive messages intended for you). We will only create a primary singing/certification key.
# Use GPG to add an additional encryption and signing subkey to your keypair. These new subkeys are linked to your main key. Now we have two subkeys. Store the whole key in a protected place. Your master keypair is the one whose compromise would be truly catastrophic.
# Then create a slave key which won't contain your master key.
# Copy your slave key to your every day operating system.

= Prerequisites =
It is recommended to first quickly read this article from top to bottom without taking actions. After you roughly understood how it's supposed to work, re-read this page and do it step-by-step. Exercise this with test keys first. If that works, consider doing this with your primary keys.

Make backups of your existing GnuPG files ($HOME/.gnupg). Keep them safe. If something goes wrong during the following steps, you may need this to return to a known good place. 

You should know how to boot other operating systems than your primary every day operating system from Live DVD and/or other external media such as USB.

Optionally, if your storage medium could get accessed or stolen by an adversary, it is also recommended to learn how to use disk encryption software. As a precaution, it's wise to do this anyway.

Additionally to protect yourself against mistakes it may make sense to manage your gpg master key folder with a version revision system such as git.

= Creating your Air Gapped OpenPGP Key =
== Preparation ==
Boot your air gapped system.

&lt;pre&gt;
mkdir ~/gpg-master
mkdir ~/.gnupg
chmod 700 ~/gpg-master
chmod 700 ~/.gnupg
&lt;/pre&gt;

Create a {{Code|~/gpg-master/gpg.conf}} and {{Code|~/.gnupg/gpg.conf}}. Source: [https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/blob/master/gpg.conf gpg.conf optimized for privacy] Check if there is a newer version available. It probably makes sense to copy that file to an USB stick beforehand so you don't have to type it by hand.

## When creating a key, individuals may designate a specific keyserver to use to pull their keys from.
## The above option will disregard this designation and use the pool, which is useful because (1) it
## prevents someone from designating an insecure method for pulling their key and (2) if the server
## designated uses hkps, the refresh will fail because the ca-cert will not match, so the keys will
## never be refreshed.

fixed-list-mode

## long keyids are more collision-resistant than short keyids (it's trivial to make a key with any desired short keyid)

## If you use a graphical environment (and even if you don't) you should be using an agent:
## (similar arguments as https://www.debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/64)

## You should always know at a glance which User IDs gpg thinks are legitimately bound to the keys in your keyring:

== Creating your Initial Keypair ==
Use the {{Code2|gpg ‐‐gen-key}} command to create a new GPG keypair.

When you create your new keypair, use the highest possible values for key length. As computers get more powerful and storage gets cheaper, it’s conceivable that a nasty person could archive a message that’s unbreakable today, then in the future break it using a more powerful computer. Using the highest possible value for key length helps protect you from that scenario. Don’t use GPG’s default of 2048!

To prevent filling up the keyserver with garbage and outdated keys or if something goes wrong, it's recommended to set an expire data on your key.

When prompted for a passphrase, make sure to pick a long and unique one. It will be your passphrase for your master key. (We'll later set a different passphrase for your slave key.) If your key gets stolen, this passphrase is the only thing protecting it! Don't use a passphrase you've ever used on your every day operating system, because that will help you to store a backup of your private master key on your every day operating system and thanks to the passphrase protection, you can even back it up in places without strong guarantees of privacy such as free cloud hosting or you public homepage. Just remember, to never enter the passphrase on your every day operating system.

gpg&gt; save
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Exporting your Master Key ==
Now that your keypair has been created, let’s export it so that we can back it up:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --homedir ~/gpg-master --armor --export-secret-keys 0x2516E552C8D4D937 &gt; 0x2516E552C8D4D937.private.gpg-key
gpg --homedir ~/gpg-master --armor --export 0x2516E552C8D4D937 &gt; 0x2516E552C8D4D937.public.gpg-key
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will create two files: your public key and your private key. Backup these two files, as best as you can.

= Creating your Slave Key =
== Export Secret Subkeys ==
Now we have our master keypair in our keyring, along with two files representing the master keypair plus the keypair’s revocation certificate. To derive our slave keypair from our master keypair, we have to create a copy of our master keypair and remove the master secret key.

Export all of the subkeys from our new keypair to a file:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --homedir ~/gpg-master --armor --export-secret-subkeys 0x2516E552C8D4D937 &gt; subkeys
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Create your Slave Key without Master Key ==
'''We are now no longer using {{Code|--homedir ~/gpg-master}}!'''

Re-import the sub keys we exported.
&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --import subkeys
&lt;/pre&gt;

Clean up our temporary file.

&lt;pre&gt;
rm subkeys
&lt;/pre&gt;

Re-import our public key we exported.

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --import 0x2516E552C8D4D937.public.gpg-key
&lt;/pre&gt;

Set a new password for your slave key. Remember, you'll have two different passwords. One for your master key, one for your slave key.

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --edit-key 0x2516E552C8D4D937
passwd
...
save
&lt;/pre&gt;

That’s all! You can verify it worked by running:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --list-secret-keys
/home/user/gpg-slave/secring.gpg
-----------------------------
sec#  4096R/488BA441 2013-03-13
uid                  Bilbo Baggins &lt;bilbo@shire.org&gt;
ssb   4096R/69B0EA85 2013-03-13
ssb   4096R/C24C2CDA 2013-03-13
&lt;/pre&gt;

See how the third line begins with “sec#”, not “sec”? The pound sign means the signing subkey is not in the keypair located in the keyring. Or more correctly said, see footnote. &lt;ref&gt;The pound sign means that the mainkey has been replaced by a stub.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make sure everything is alright, use switch gpg's homedir to {{Code|~/gpg-master}} and see if the secret master key is available.

Store your slave key in a file.

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys 0x2516E552C8D4D937 &gt; 0x2516E552C8D4D937.secret-subkeys.gpg-key
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can now copy your public key, master key and slave key to a disk and import your public key and your slave key to your every day operating system(s).

= In Case of Emergency =
Should the worst happen and your slave keypair gets lost, compromised or stolen, we need to revoke the subkeys on that keypair.

Unlock your safe-deposit box and get your master keypair out.

Boot a live USB of Debian or your distro of choice. Then, import your master keypair into the live USB’s keyring:

&lt;pre&gt;
gpg --import /path/to/0x2516E552C8D4D937.public.gpg-key /path/to/0x2516E552C8D4D937.private.gpg-key
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now use {{Code2|gpg ‐‐edit-key}} to interactively revoke your subkeys:

&lt;pre&gt;

Now that your subkey has been revoked, you have to tell the world about it by distributing your key to a keyserver, then you have to add new subkeys.

= Other Interesting Stuff =
== Backups ==
Make sure you always have a backup of your master key in case one USB stick breaks down. Maybe you like to use paperkey [http://packages.debian.org/jessie/paperkey (in debian)] for that purpose.

== Smartcards ==
You can then use the smartcard on your everyday system without risk of exposing the private keys (i.e. they cannot be copied from the smartcard but it is possible to abuse them on the smartcard which can cause less but severe damage, too). Smartcards are worth checking out, but outside the scope of this guide.

= Security Considerations =
'''You can skip this if you are not interested in this! This is just a justification why we do things as we do.'''

Alex Cabal's original text recommends to use {{Code2|gpg --delete-secret-key}}. We're not using this for two reasons.

* Securely wiping of data [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_remanence is a difficult issue]. We believe it is safer to create a new keypair (a new secring.gpg) than trusting gpg to remove the private master key from secring.gpg. This is just an assumption, could be FUD.
* Users may confuse the gpg-master homedir from their gpg-slave homedir after using like ten times the gpg-master homedir. When they don't carefully read, they could accidentally delete their master key.

Our every day operating system never gets to see our OpenPGP master key, because we regard our every day operating system to be untrusted for these purposes.

Alex Cabal's original text uses {{Code2|gpg e-mail@address}}, we're using short key ids to avoid user mistakes when editing more complex keys.

Alex Cabal's original text uses gpg setpref and we're using a gpg config file to have these settings enforced already during key creation.

|description=Troubleshooting Installation and Network Issues with Whonix
}}

= Installation and Network Issues =
== Introduction ==
This introduction is a summary of the basic troubleshooting instructions. It will be described below in greater details. This basically boils down to:

# If you haven't already done, verify the Whonix virtual machine images.
# Make sure you have imported the Virtual Machines into a supported virtualizer (currently only VirtualBox).
# Check if the [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Tor Browser Bundle] works for you on the host.
# Check if other Virtual Box virtual machines, ones you created yourself or from a different vendor have working internet.

Include all these information in a support request or bug report.

== Before you start ==
[[Download#Verify_the_Whonix_images|Verify the Whonix virtual machine images]].

== On the host ==
=== General ===
Always test first, if your host internet connection is working. (ping 8.8.8.8, ping google.com, etc). On your host:

&lt;pre&gt;
ping google.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check time.

&lt;pre&gt;
date
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Code2|sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a}} must not show any errors. Will take a while...

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Code2|sudo dpkg --configure -a}} must be silent, i.e. not show any errors, must show output at all. Will take a while...

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg --configure -a
&lt;/pre&gt;

Get all updates:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check VirtualBox version.

&lt;pre&gt;
vboxmanage --version
&lt;/pre&gt;

Get the Tor Browser Bundle from [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en torproject.org] and test if it's working.

&lt;pre&gt;
## If you can not get the Tor Browser Bundle to work,
## you will most certainly not get Whonix to work either.
##
## In the Whonix Documentation it is recommended to have a current
## copy of the Tor Browser Bundle at all times.
##
## The Tor Browser Bundle is great for testing if you live in a
## censored area or not, if Tor is blocked by your ISP or not.
## When you need (private) (obfuscated) bridges for the Tor Browser Bundle,
## you will need them for Whonix as well.
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Import Whonix images ===
Importing the images with the VirtualBox GUI should work well in most cases. If not, please check first if you have enough free disk space. Please also refer to the Whonix [[Install|Install Screenshots]] or [[Videos|Video Tutorials]].

Delete any half imported or otherwise broken virtual machine images by using the VBoxManage command line tool. Copy the output.

&lt;pre&gt;
VBoxManage unregistervm &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; --delete
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
VBoxManage unregistervm &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot; --delete
&lt;/pre&gt;

Go to the folder where you downloaded Whonix. Import Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation by using the VBoxManage command line tool.

&lt;pre&gt;
VBoxManage import Whonix-Gateway.ova
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
VBoxManage import Whonix-Workstation.ova
&lt;/pre&gt;

Clean (anonymize) the output.

&lt;pre&gt;
# Remove operating system user name or any problematic paths.
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[Contact|Contact Whonix developer]] by sending the output.

&lt;pre&gt;
.
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== No network inside Whonix? ===
If you have trouble with networking inside Whonix virtual machines, maybe something went wrong while installing VirtualBox. In this case,

# Please install some operating system in one of your own virtual machine or download a regular image without Tor enforcement [http://virtualboximages.com/ elsewhere].
# Try if networking is functional in the freshly downloaded non-Whonix virtual machine.
# If it's not working: then Whonix won't work either. You need to sort that out first. Try re-installing VirtualBox. Deinstall VirtualBox, reboot, re-install VirtualBox, reboot, try again.
# If it's working: add this to your support request or bug report, that networking in other non-Whonix VMs is working.

== On the Gateway ==
=== As user {{Code2|user}} ===
Login as user {{Code2|user}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo su user
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check your &lt;code&gt;route&lt;/code&gt; command, make sure the network 192.168.0.0 is associated with eth1.

&lt;pre&gt;
route&lt;/pre&gt;

Check if Tor is running with 'pgrep tor -l', this should return something like &quot;103 tor&quot;. If not try 'sudo service tor start' and check for any errors.

&lt;pre&gt;
pgrep tor -l
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check the status of Tor.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service tor status | less
&lt;/pre&gt;

Should reply with.

&lt;pre&gt;
tor is running.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart Tor.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service tor restart | less
&lt;/pre&gt;

Tor should show only notices, no errors.

Verify Tor configuration is valid:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo tor --verify-config | less
&lt;/pre&gt;

You should see confirmation:

&lt;pre&gt;
Configuration was valid
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ping the Whonix-Workstation.

&lt;pre&gt;
ping 192.168.0.11
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ping VirtualBox.

&lt;pre&gt;
ping 10.0.2.2
&lt;/pre&gt;

Should show {{Code2|Packet filtered}}.

nslookup should NOT work.

&lt;pre&gt;
nslookup google.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

Should show timeout.

=== As user {{Code2|unsafe}} ===
Login as user {{Code2|unsafe}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo su unsafe
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''The following tests in this very &quot;Login as unsafe&quot; chapter might reveal, that you are a Whonix user. Omit them, if that is of concern for you.'''

unsafe user account has no password. Login with

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo su unsafe
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remove write protection from /etc/resolv.conf

&lt;pre&gt;
chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart networking. DHCP will rewrite /etc/resolv.conf (Temporary login as root.)

&lt;pre&gt;
service networking restart
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check /etc/resolv.conf.

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /etc/resolv.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

Content should be:

&lt;pre&gt;
nameserver 10.0.2.2
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check if dns resolution is functional.

&lt;pre&gt;
nslookup google.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Tests on both Virtual Machines ==
Run the following tests on Whonix-Gateway and on Whonix-Workstation.

Login as user {{Code2|user}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo su user
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check time.

&lt;pre&gt;
date
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Code2|sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a}} must not show any errors. Will take a while...

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Code2|sudo dpkg --configure -a}} must be silent, i.e. not show any errors, must show output at all. Will take a while...

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg --configure -a
&lt;/pre&gt;

Test update-grub.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo update-grub
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run 'locale'. Must not report any error.

&lt;pre&gt;
locale
sudo locale
&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart networking:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service networking restart | less
&lt;/pre&gt;

Apt-get must be fully functional.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;

Test whonixcheck.

&lt;pre&gt;
whonixcheck
&lt;/pre&gt;

Test whonixcheck with debugging.

&lt;pre&gt;
whonixcheck --verbose
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check the timezone.

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /etc/timezone
&lt;/pre&gt;

Must be {{Code2|Etc/UTC}}.

= Verifiable Builds =
== Verifiable .ova's ==
=== Introduction - What this Archives ===
{{Verifiable Ovas Introduction}}

=== Short Overview - How it Works ===
When building Whonix {{Code2|.ova}}'s from source code, for example {{Code2|/home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Gateway-8.ova}} also report {{Code2|/home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Gateway-8.report}} file will be created.

After building the {{Code2|.ova}}, the last build-step will extract the {{Code2|.ova}}, which will result getting three files, i.e. {{Code2|Whonix-Gateway-8.ovf}}, {{Code2|Whonix-Gateway-8.mf}} and {{Code2|Whonix-Gateway-8-disk1.vmdk}}. The {{Code2|.vmdk}}&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMDK&lt;/ref&gt; image then will be converted to {{Code2|.vdi}}&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDI_(file_format)&lt;/ref&gt;, then converted to {{Code2|raw}}&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Code2|.img}}. (Converting as in creating a copy, not actually converting.) The filesystem layout, the MBR&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record&lt;/ref&gt; and the VBR&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_boot_record&lt;/ref&gt; are written in to separate files. The raw image will then be mounted. A sha512 checksum of every file will be created and stored in the report.

Anyone building {{Code2|Whonix.ova}} images will hopefully end up with the same report. We can then compare the reports using tools such as {{Code2|diff}} and/or {{Code2|meld}}. Those reports should be very similar. We can't end up with the very same reports, because again, there are no deterministically built operating systems yet. However, we can manually review the few remaining differences. That should make it reasonable to believe, that the original {{Code2|Whonix.ova}} images have been build from the source code that has been published for that Whonix version.

Below on this page is a longer How-To.

=== Current Limitations ===
During the build process of Whonix-Gateway we are still using torproject.org's Tor repository for Debian testing&lt;ref&gt;http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/dists/testing/main/binary-i386/Packages&lt;/ref&gt;. Should that version get upgraded, this will create differences. In theory, old files could still be verified against torproject's signing keys, but that would require them to be archived somewhere. [http://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/990/is-there-an-archive-of-deb-torproject-org/1000?noredirect=1#1000 There is currently no such archive. (Peter Palfrader offered to provide them on request).] Whonix is currently only easily verifiable as long as torproject.org's repository does not get upgraded. In future, when Tor 0.2.4 migrates into Debian testing, this limitation may be lifted. We're happy to hear better solutions in meanwhile.

Our {{Code2|[https://github.com/adrelanos/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/analyze_image help-steps/analyze_image]}} script does not check the contents of the image outside the file system. We're not aware of any method getting a backdoor activated by writing malicious data into those places. We might get rid of this limitation in future, see chapter Possible Future Improvements.

We don't check GUID&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table&lt;/ref&gt;, because we're not using GUID. &lt;ref&gt;You can verify that by auditing Whonix's source code.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attack Surface ===
The {{Code2|/help-steps/analyze_image}} script is supposed to execute no code from the image you are analyzing. The risk running that script on images you did not create yourself such as on the official images should be low, but not non-existent. Audits of the analyzing script itself are most welcome. In order to analyze the image, tools which are available in Debian's repository are used. Such as extracting the .ova requires {{Code2|tar}}&lt;ref&gt;http://packages.debian.org/jessie/tar&lt;/ref&gt;. In theory, the {{Code2|.ova}} could be malformed in a way to exploit the auditor's machine while extracting it to coerce the auditor's machine create a legit report hiding the actual backdoor (and infecting the auditor's machine with a backdoor). To find out what other tools are used and for what, please have a look at the {{Code2|/help-steps/analyze_image}} script.

=== Theoretical Holes ===
Unfortunately, we can not directly mount the {{Code2|.ova}}. We have to extract it first. Rather, Virtual Box does not support creating {{Code2|.ova}} containing {{Code2|.img}} (raw images). Img's would be ideal, since low level tools such as {{Code2|dd}} understand them. Even worse, {{Code2|.ova}}'s created by Virtual Box always include {{Code2|.vmdk}}. [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=58460 export VM using VDI instead of VMDK is not possible]. Rather [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=58461 Mounting VMDK's on Debian testing/jessie] using Free Software is currently not possible since no software supports that. During the convert process {{Code2|ova -&gt; vmdk -&gt; vdi -&gt; img}}, the MBR, bootloader, VBR and/or other obscure differences could occur. There is no reason to believe that is actually the case, but we're not aware of any research on that topic.

=== Your Own Alternatives ===
The {{Code2|/help-steps/analyze_image}} script is the tool which comes with Whonix's source code to audit {{Code2|Whonix.ova}}. Nothing prevents you from cooking up your own custom method to verify {{Code2|Whonix.ova}}. On the contrary, we'd be very happy to hear about your methods, source code and results. Since this hasn't ever happened in past, Whonix came up with its own {{Code2|/help-steps/analyze_image}} script.

=== Possible Future Improvements ===
[https://github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit/ sleuthkit] could be an interesting addition or even replacement for our custom script. Then we could create a report using something like {{Code|fls -f ext4 ./Whonix-Gateway-8.img}}. Does {{Code|fls}} very similar results when run on very similar images or does it mess up the ordering? The version in Debian even in [http://packages.debian.org/sid/sleuthkit sid] is outdated and does unfortunately not include support for ext4 and our images are using ext4. More recent sleuthkit upstream releases do support ext4, but there are no signed git tags yet ([https://github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit/issues/264 reported an issue]), so getting sleuthkit is a bit difficult. (If we want to defeat sophisticated backdoors, we shouldn't encourage auditors to blindly trust github's SSL alone for sleuthkit's integrity.) We could think about bending our images, downgrading from ext4 to ext3.

=== Expected Differences ===
* {{Code|(mount_folder) /boot/initrd.img*}} - Those are extracted to the {{Code|initrd_folder}} and diffed.
* {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/fstab}} - Will contains different uuids. We could make them uniform, but that would complicate the code, manually look at the diff. &lt;font size=-3&gt;(Will no longer be necessary in Whonix 8.5.0.1 and above, because fixed disk identifiers will be used.)&lt;/font&gt;
* {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/shadow}} - Manually look at the diff. Users are advised to change their passwords anyway.
* {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/shadow-}} - Same as above.
* {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/init.d/.depend.boot}} - {{Code|/sbin/insserv}} (part of sysvinit) does not produce deterministic results. Gets copied to the {{Code|manual_analysis_folder}}. Manually review them. You just have to check, they're not containing anything sketchy. You most likely won't be able to tell, if some services are deliberately not started or in wrong order. This is not an issue, because when Whonix starts for the first time it executes {{Code|whonix_shared/usr/lib/whonix/first_run_initializer}}, which executes {{Code|/sbin/insserv}}, which recreates this file. &lt;ref&gt;We can not delete this file before redistributing Whonix, because then Whonix wouldn't start.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/init.d/.depend.start}} - Same as above.
* {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/init.d/.depend.stop}} - Same as above.
* {{Code|(mount_folder) /usr/share/whonix_build_timestamp}} - Timestamp, naturally differs.
* {{Code|(mount_folder) /var/lib/initramfs-tools/...}} - Is a one-line text file, which contains the name of the initrd and its checksum. Differs, because the initrd isn't deterministic in the first place.
* {{Code|(mount_folder) /var/lib/initramfs-tools/...}} - Same as above.
* {{Code|(manual_analysis_folder) *.dd.1000000}} - The first ~1MB of the {{Code2|.img}}. Disk signature will differ. &lt;font size=-3&gt;(Will no longer be necessary in Whonix 8.5.0.1 and above, because fixed disk identifiers will be used.)&lt;/font&gt;

=== Unexpected Differences ===
There could be differences besides the expected differences, because this is still experimental as in a new feature. Remember, there are no deterministically built distributions yet. If you find any additional differences, keep calm, it's not necessarily a backdoor, report them, and if you can, diff and/or audit them.

=== Folder Overview ===
Your report root folder can most likely be found in {{Code|/home/user/whonix_binary/$VMNAME-${whonix_build_whonix_version_new}_report_tempfolder}}.

{{Code|extracted_ova_folder}} - Should contain 3 files. One {{Code2|.vmdk}}, which you can ignore, that's what we unpack - if we could diff it in the first place we wouldn't have so much trouble. Since the contents of the extracted_ova_folder gets added to the file_list, it won't be possible, that there are any extra files - if there were, you could see them in the report and should be suspicious.

{{Code|vdi_folder}} - Should only contain one {{Code2|.vdi}}. If we could diff it in the first place we wouldn't have so much trouble.

{{Code|raw_folder}} - Should only contain one {{Code2|.img}}. Same as above.

{{Code|auto_hash_folder}} - Are all added to the {{Code2|.report}} and {{Code2|file_list}} and should contain no differences.

{{Code|extracted_initrd_folder}} - The are the extracted {{Code|(mount_folder) /boot/initrd.img*}} files. Are all added to the {{Code2|.report}} and {{Code2|file_list}} and should contain no differences.

{{Code|manual_analysis_folder}} - Not hashed in the {{Code2|.report}} file, because those will show differences anyway which we expect. Those have to be manually audited.

{{Code|debug_folder}} - We copy these files out of the images just in case for convenience. Those have been already checksum'ed (in the {{Code2|.report}} file) as regular files within the (mount_folder). Feel free to ignore that folder. It's only in for debugging purposes.

=== How-To ===
First of all, you need to create your own Whonix.ova images from source code, refer to [[Dev/Build Documentation|Build Documentation]]. Your report file can most likely be found at {{Code|/home/user/whonix_binary/$VMNAME-$whonix_build_whonix_version_new.report}} and your report_tempfolder at {{Code|/home/user/whonix_binary/$VMNAME-${whonix_build_whonix_version_new}_tempfolder}}. That is your own analyzed {{Code2|.ova}}. To make space for another analysis for other builds (such as those from whonix.org), rename your whonix_binary folder to something else, such as {{Code2|whonix_binary1}}.

If you've build for example Whonix 8, you have to download Whonix 8 as well. Place the {{Code2|.ova}} in {{Code|/home/user/whonix_binary/}}. Keep the original name. Then go to Whonix's source code folder ({{Code|cd /home/user/Whonix}} and analyze that image. Use.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./build-steps.d/2800_create-report --tor-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

(And later repeat that step with the --tor-workstation switch.)

Then you have two {{Code2|.report}} files and two report temp folders.

Use your favorite diff viewer for huge files. For example {{Code2|meld}}. Diff the reports. For example, use.

&lt;pre&gt;
meld ./whonix_binary1/Whonix-Gateway-8.report ./whonix_binary/Whonix-Gateway-8.report
&lt;/pre&gt;

These files should be very similar, expect for a few differences which we earlier mentioned in chapter Expected Differences. Look at the differences. Two of them (because we're installing two kernels) should look like this:

{{Code|(mount_folder) /boot/initrd.img...}}

Check at the top of your report files for (extracted_initrd_folder) and see if both initrd's were really extracted. &lt;ref&gt;They should, because otherwise if extraction failed, the {{Code2|analyze_image}} script should have failed earlier and informed you already.&lt;/ref&gt;

Check for more differences, you can ignore {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/fstab}} for now, this is an expected difference and we audit them later. &lt;font size=-3&gt;(Will no longer be necessary in Whonix 8.5.0.1 and above, because fixed disk identifiers will be used.)&lt;/font&gt;

Also ignore {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/init.d/.depend.boot}}, {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/init.d/.depend.start}}, and {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/init.d/.depend.stop}} for now, this is an expected difference and we audit them later.

Also ignore {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/shadow}} and {{Code|(mount_folder) /etc/shadow-}} for now, this is an expected difference and we audit them later.

Also ignore {{Code|(mount_folder) /usr/share/whonix_build_timestamp}} for now, this is an expected difference and we audit them later.

Also ignore {{Code|(mount_folder) /var/lib/initramfs-tools/...}} for now, this is an expected difference and we audit them later.

There should be no other differences in the {{Code2|.report}} files!

Now it's time to audit the differencing files which we ignored above.

Diff the virtual machine description file {{Code|(extracted_ova_folder) *.ovf}}. Only the uuids should differ. (The extracted_ova_folder folder can be found in your report_temp folders.)

Diff the manifest file {{Code|(extracted_ova_folder) *.mf}}. Only the checksums should differ.

Diff the first ~1 MB of .img (contains MBR and bootloader) {{Code|(manual_analysis_folder) *.dd.1000000}} - Use for example {{Code|vbindiff ....dd.1000000 *.dd.1000000}}. Only the disk signature should differ. &lt;font size=-3&gt;(Will no longer be necessary in Whonix 8.5.0.1 and above, because fixed disk identifiers will be used.)&lt;/font&gt;

Finally diff the rest of the files in your {{Code2|manual_analysis_folder}}. Using a diff application which can diff whole folders such as {{Code2|meld}} would be useful, but what tools you use is up to you. Have a look at the &quot;Expected Differences&quot; chapter above for the kind of differences you can expect.

Auditing these files is unfortunately a bit difficult. The best tip to be given is to use your common sense. For example, having two {{Code2|/etc/init.d/.depend.start}} files at same size, but different order is probably not a backdoor. But if there are a lot extra lines looking weird ([http://security.stackexchange.com/a/40108 unrelated example code]), there might be something wrong.

Shouldn't they match, you could also compare them using {{Code|debdiff}}.

We don't have a script yet to automate that process.

== Implementation ==
In case you like to review the implementation, the related scripts can be found here:

* Remove most non-deterministic parts (auto generated files which always look at bit different): https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-post.d/90_cleanup
* Build step to create the report: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/2800_create-report
* The analyze image script, which creates the report: https://github.com/adrelanos/Whonix/blob/master/help-steps/analyze_image
* The user interface locally re-creating non-deterministic files when Whonix starts for the first time: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/lib/whonix/first_run_initializer_gui
* Re-creating non-deterministic files when Whonix starts for the first time: https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_shared/usr/lib/whonix/first_run_initializer

By default Whonix's last build step creates a report file of all hdd contents. (See [[Verifiable Builds]] for details.) This step is optional. First introduced in Whonix 7.4.8. Whonix should work fine without that step. It is used for extra security. This step takes quite some time. This step is recommended. If you want to disable it, click on Expand on the right side.

Do you want to &lt;u&gt;opt-out&lt;/u&gt; of the report creation build step? Then do these steps as it follows.

Create {{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} folder.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir --parents /etc/whonix_buildconfig.d
&lt;/pre&gt;

Create {{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d/50_no_report}} build config file.

&lt;pre&gt;
echo '# This file is part of Whonix
# Copyright (C) 2012 - 2013 adrelanos &lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;
# See the file COPYING for copying conditions.

whonix_build_script_minimal_report=&quot;1&quot;
' | sudo tee &quot;/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d/50_no_report&quot; &gt; /dev/null

Check.

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /etc/whonix_buildconfig.d/50_no_report
&lt;/pre&gt;

Should show what we echoed above.

If you want to undo this build configuration, see footnote. &lt;ref&gt;

|description=Overview of Ways to Backup your Whonix Virtual Machines
}}

= Overview - Ways to Backup Whonix VMs =
There isn't a great and simple way to make backups yet. Best you can do is either:

* [[File Transfer]]
* and/or use the export feature of Virtual Box, that will create standalone .ova files which you should be able to easily import on any other machine and/or
* Create a copy of your VM files. There is some important knowledge you have to be aware of, this is documented below.

= General Important Recommendation =
Creating backups is only the first step. You should do a test run if you are actually to restore your backup. Otherwise you may experience a nasty surprise that some files are missing for successful restore.

= Important Knowledge =
== ~/VirtualBox VMs Folder ==
If you want to copy your Virtual Box's to another harddrive, only creating a backup of your &quot;~/VirtualBox VMs&quot; folder won't suffice. You have to remember to have a backup of your Virtual Box settings folder (~/.VirtualBox) as well, because manually re-creating that folder is difficult and undocumented by Virtual Box's documentation.

== Using Virtual Box's VM Cloning Feature for Backups isn't Simple ==
The clone feature of Virtual Box is not very user friendly for backups for the same reason as above. It works, for cloning VMs, but it's not very useful for easy backups, because general VM settings are still stored in your home folder (~/.VirtualBox) and these are difficult to restore as mentioned above. So if you use the clone feature and backup your VMs on a different harddrive, you have to remember to have a backup of your Virtual Box settings folder (~/.VirtualBox) as well.

== Backup Virtual Box Settings Files ==
Turn off Virtual Box before attempting to backup the Virtual Box's settings folder (~/.VirtualBox).

When you change VM settings, add/remove VMs, add/remove virtual hdds, add/remove snapshots you should create a new backup.

= Advanced Users =
Adding your Virtual Box settings folder to a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control revision control system] such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software) git] is a good additions to backups of Virtual Box's settings folder. Should Virtual Box damage your settings file and its backup file (happens sometimes), you can try a recent backup from an earlier git revision.

= See Also =
* [[Manually_Create_Whonix_VM_Settings|Manually Create Whonix VM Settings, in case you want to restore a backup of .vdi hard disk image files]]

Since Whonix 7.5.2, advanced users who build Whonix from source code can increase certainty, that their image is free from perhaps anonymity critical bugs, by verifying, that their image is very similar to redistributed Whonix .ova's. This is optional, but can improve security.

If you are interested, click on Expand on the right.
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
Congratulations, you already created your own build of Whonix. If you want, you can compare your build with official builds for better security. See [[Verifiable Builds]].

Warning:

For this feature adding security, it needs your help! Do not assume, that others are doing it for you.
}}

Whonix has a feature which allows the community to check that Whonix {{Code2|.ova}}&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format&lt;/ref&gt; releases are verifiably created from project's own source code. We call this verifiable builds. This only proves, that the person and machine&lt;ref&gt;Due to build machine compromise.&lt;/ref&gt; building Whonix has added nothing malicious, such as a backdoor&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)&lt;/ref&gt;. It doesn't prove, that there are no backdoors in Debian. This isn't possible, because neither Debian&lt;ref&gt;Whonix is based on Debian.&lt;/ref&gt; nor any other operating system provides deterministic builds yet.&lt;ref&gt;Some Debian developres are working on it, see [https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds Reproducible Builds].&lt;/ref&gt; Rather this feature is no attempt to proof, that there aren't any vulnerabilities&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)&lt;/ref&gt; in Whonix's or Debian. A remotely exploitable&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)&lt;/ref&gt; bug in Whonix or Debian, a flaw in Whonix's firewall leaking traffic or code {{Code2|phoning home}}&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoning_home&lt;/ref&gt; the contents of your harddrive would still be fatal. A precondition so this feature can improve overall security is, that the community is auditing Whonix's and Debian's source code for being free of backdoors and vulnerabilities in the first place. In summary, we believe this feature is useful and can improve security, but however isn't a magical answer to all computer security and trust questions. The following table hopefully helps understanding what this feature archives.

{{Verifiable_Builds_Comparsion_Table}}

You might be curious, why Whonix is verifiable while neither Debian nor any other operating system is? This is because [[About#Based_on_Debian|Whonix is very simple]], to oversimplify it: Whonix is just a collection of configuration files and scripts, i.e. Whonix's source code does not contain any compiled code etc. On the other hand, Debian is a full operating system. And of course, without the great work of the Debian project and all the upstream projects, Whonix wouldn't exist.

This feature was first available with Whonix 8. Only users who download a new image can profit from this feature. Auditing versions older than Whonix 8 with this script is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;Not possible doesn't mean impossible here. Would just involve lots of work.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Because in order to implement the verifiable builds feature, we need to get rid of lots of non-deterministic auto-generated files at the end of the build process and to re-create them during first boot.&lt;/ref&gt;</text>

Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en&lt;/ref&gt;, Debian GNU/Linux&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian&lt;/ref&gt; and security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP.

Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.

To learn more about security and anonymity under Whonix, please continue to the [[About|About Whonix]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="366">Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en&lt;/ref&gt;, Debian GNU/Linux&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian&lt;/ref&gt; and security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP.</text>

Whonix virtual machine images are cryptographically signed using OpenPGP&lt;ref&gt;OpenPGP is a standard for data encryption that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication through the use of keys owned by its users.&lt;/ref&gt; by Whonix developer Patrick Schleizer.

If you know how to use an OpenPGP key, download the [[Whonix Signing Key|Whonix Signing Key]] and the [[#Download Whonix|Whonix signatures]] straight away.

Otherwise, follow the instructions:

* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Linux|For Linux: Ubuntu, Debian, Whonix, etc. using kgpg]]
* [[Verify the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command line|For Linux with the command line]]
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_other_operating systems|For Windows or Mac]]

= Install Whonix =

== 1. Before installing ==

Read and apply the [[Pre_Install_Advice|Security Advice]].

== 2. Install ==

* Download and install [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads VirtualBox]. &lt;ref&gt;You could alternatively search for a Portable VirtualBox&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[#Download Whonix|Download Whonix]] and import both Whonix images&lt;ref&gt;You need both Whonix-Gateway.ova and Whonix-Workstation.ova images. Whonix is a two machine setup.&lt;/ref&gt; into VirtualBox. Do not change any settings when importing!
* Take a snapshot for both Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation on VirtualBox. So you can easily restore the original snapshot whenever you need a clean state.

=== Need help? ===

There is a tutorial with screenshots, see [[Install|Install]].

There are also [[Videos|Video Tutorials]].

If you still need help, please check the [[Support|Support]] page.

== 3. After installing ==

Read and apply the [[Post Install Advice|Post Install Advice]].

=  Stay tuned =

== Introduction ==
Reading the latest news is important to stay on top of latest developments. Should security vulnerabilities ever be found in Whonix or should an improved version be released, you should be informed.

== Whonix News Blogs ==
[[File:Whonix News Blog opened offline created by adrelanos.png|thumb|alt=Whonix News Blogs Screenshot|Whonix News Blogs]]
There are two ways to get news. Choose at your preference.

# [https://anonymousoperatingsystem.wordpress.com/category/important/ Whonix Important Blog] - Most important stuff only. Security vulnerabilities and new stable versions only. For people with very limited time and interest in Whonix development and news.
# [https://anonymousoperatingsystem.wordpress.com/ Whonix Feature Blog] - Includes everything from Whonix Important Blog. Also testers-only and developers versions are announced. Has a relaxed posting policy. Also blog posts about updated articles, new features, future features, development, call for testing, general project thoughts and so on will be published.

When you start '''Tor Browser Recommended''', there is a shortcut on the desktop, see [[Image:important.png|alt=Tor Browser Recommend Icon|r]] , it will open both Whonix News Blogs in a privacy friendly way. It's recommended at least to read Whonix Important Blog if you are in a hurry. Have a look into Whonix Feature Blog if you are generally interested to learn about anonymity/privacy/security related things or to see what's going on with Whonix.

== Operating System Updates ==
You should regularly check for operating system updates on your host operating system, on Whonix-Workstation and on Whonix-Gateway as highly recommended in the [[Security Guide|Security Guide]].

== Tor Browser ==
[[Image:whonixcheck_gui.png|alt=whonixcheck graphical user interface screenshot|[[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]]|thumb]]

There is no auto-update feature for Tor Browser. You will be notified about new Tor Browser versions by [[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]]. Tor Browser's built in update check mechanism also works in Whonix. For instructions how to update the browser, see [[Tor Browser|Tor Browser]]. Additionally it might also be wise to subscribe to https://blog.torproject.org for news.

== Whonix Version Check and Whonix News ==
[[File:whonixcheck created by adrelanos.png|alt=whonixcheck graphical user interface screnshot|thumb|Whonix Version Check (first rectangle in black) and&lt;br /&gt;Whonix News &lt;br /&gt;(second rectangle in green)]]
Furthermore you will be automatically notified about new Whonix versions by Whonix Version Check and about the most important occurrences&lt;ref&gt;Such as when a version becomes unsupported, if manual action is required, if major features break, or if security vulnerabilities are found. The policy is to use Whonix News as rarely as possible.&lt;/ref&gt; by Whonix News, both of which are part of [[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]].

== Social Media Profiles ==
There are some [[Official Whonix Online Profiles|Whonix Social Media Profiles]], but please don't rely on them for getting Whonix News and please don't use them to contact Whonix developers. (See [[Contact|Contact]] for contact information.)

Because some people will do so even though it is not recommended, messages from the Whonix Feature Blog will be automatically mirrored to [https://twitter.com/Whonix Whonix Twitter Profile], to [https://www.facebook.com/Whonix Whonix Facebook Profile] and to [https://plus.google.com/108150429836421683225/ Whonix Google+ Profile].

If you won't get into trouble by letting others learn about Whonix, feel free to follow or like those profiles (with your anonymous account) as a little way to [[Contribute|Contribute]].

== Source Code ==
In case you are interested in Whonix source code updates, [[Dev/git#subscribe_to_code_changes|subscribe to code changes]].

= Known bugs =

== Normal ==

=== Mounting (CD/DVD) Devices ===
You can use the following workaround.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom/
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following message.

&lt;pre&gt;
mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
&lt;/pre&gt;

Is expected. (It's normal that CD/DVD's are mounted read-only.)

Help fixing this bug is welcome!

=== VLC / Video Player Crash ===

You can use this workaround.
&lt;pre&gt;
VLC -&gt; Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Video -&gt; Output -&gt; X11 -&gt; Save
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Minor ==

=== &quot;apt-get source package&quot; will show &quot;dpkg-source: warning: failed to verify signature&quot; ===
More info [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2013/08/msg00000.html here] (and in the following mails).

It is only a warning. If you want, you can get rid of it with the following workaround.

1. Modify &lt;code&gt;/etc/dpkg/origins/default&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/debian /etc/dpkg/origins/default
&lt;/pre&gt;

2. {{Code|apt-get source package}}

3. Undo afterwards to prevent unexpected issues.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/whonix /etc/dpkg/origins/default
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Introduction =

Even though we're doing our best to offer you good tools to protect your privacy while using a computer, '''there is no magic or perfect solution to such a complex problem'''.

= Tor exit relays can eavesdrop on communications =

'''Tor is about hiding your location, not about encrypting your communication.'''

Instead of taking a direct route from source to destination, communications using the Tor network take a random pathway through several Tor relays that cover your tracks. So no observer at any single point can tell where the data came from or where it's going.

[[Image:htw2-tails.png|frame|none|alt=| A Tor connection usually goes through 3 relays with the last one establishing the actual connection to the final destination]]

The last relay on this circuit, called the exit relay, is the one that establishes the actual connection to the destination server. As Tor does not, and by design cannot, encrypt the traffic between an exit relay and the destination server, '''any exit relay is in a position to capture any traffic passing through it'''.

For example, in 2007, a security researcher intercepted thousands of private e-mail messages sent by foreign embassies and human rights groups around the world by spying on the connections coming out of an exit relay he was running. See [http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/09/embassy_hacks Wired: Rogue Nodes Turn Tor Anonymizer Into Eavesdropper's Paradise.] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyHbBEU w]).

'''To protect yourself from such attacks you should use end-to-end encryption.'''

'''Whonix includes many tools to help you using strong encryption''' while browsing, sending email or chatting in [[Documentation]].

&lt;ref&gt;Source: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#CanexitnodeseavesdroponcommunicationsIsntthatbad Tor FAQ: Can exit relays eavesdrop on communications?] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyAPZe4 w])&lt;/ref&gt;

= Whonix makes it clear that you are using Tor =

Tor tries to prevent attackers from learning what destination websites you connect to.

'''Unless''' you are using the Optional Configuration [[Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP | Hide the fact, that you are using Tor/Whonix from your ISP]], '''your ISP or your local network administrator''' can easily check that you're connecting to a Tor relay, and not a normal web server for example.

'''Unless''' you are using the Optional Configuration [[Tunnel Proxy or SSH or VPN through Tor | Tunnel Proxy/SSH/VPN through Tor]], '''the destination server you are contacting through Tor''' can know whether your communication comes out from a Tor exit relay by consulting the publicly available list of exit relays that might contact it. For example using the [https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py Tor Bulk Exit List tool] of the Tor Project.

'''So unless you are using Optional Configurations to prevent this, using Whonix doesn't make you look like any random Internet user.''' The anonymity provided by Tor and Whonix works by trying to make all of their users look the same so it's not possible to identify who is who amongst them.

Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more [https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en diverse] their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of them. Convince other people to use Tor, too!

&lt;ref&gt; Attribution: Two sentences in the &quot;Whonix makes it clear that you are using Tor&quot; chapter, have been forked from the [https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en Tor] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyWNl4n w])website, which was licensed under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/ Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyX0A2y w]) at this point. &lt;/ref&gt;

= Whonix might make it clear you are using Whonix =

Even though Whonix developers designed Whonix not to reveal the fact that you are a Whonix user to your ISP, there might still be unknown methods to find out you are.

In case you care about that, see also the Optional Configuration [[Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP | Hide the fact, that you are using Tor/Whonix from your ISP]].

= Man-in-the-middle attacks =
A man-in-the-middle attack (MitM) is a form of active eavesdropping in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them, making them believe that they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker.

[[Image:man_in_the_middle.jpg|frame|none|alt=|Illustration of a man-in-the-middle attack]]

While using Tor, man-in-the-middle attacks can still happen between the exit relay and the destination server. The exit relay itself can also act as a man-in-the-middle. For an example of such an attack see [http://www.teamfurry.com/wordpress/2007/11/20/tor-exit-node-doing-mitm-attacks MW-Blog: TOR exit-node doing MITM attacks] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUybaLf8 w]).

'''Again, to protect yourself from such attacks you should use end-to-end encryption''' and while doing so taking extra care at verifying the server authenticity.

Usually, this is automatically done through [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security SSL] certificates checked by your browser against a given set of recognized [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority certificate authorities]. If you get a security exception message such as this one you might be victim of a man-in-the-middle attack and should not bypass it unless you have another trusted way of checking the certificate's fingerprint with the people running the service.

[[Image:ssl_warning.png|frame|none|alt=|This Connection is Untrusted]]

[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-tell-if-my-connection-is-secure How do I tell if my connection to a website is secure?] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUzXi9P5 w])

The eff has a fantastic [https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https interactive illustration] who can see what when (not) using Tor and when (not) using SSL.

But on top of that, the certificate authorities model of trust on the Internet is susceptible to various methods of compromise.

For example, on March 15, 2011, Comodo, one of the major SSL certificates company, reported that a user account with an affiliate registration authority had been compromised. It was then used to create a new user account that issued nine certificate signing requests for seven domains: mail.google.com, login.live.com, www.google.com, login.yahoo.com (three certificates), login.skype.com, addons.mozilla.org, and global trustee. &lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://blogs.comodo.com/it-security/data-security/the-recent-ra-compromise/ Comodo: The Recent RA Compromise] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyeEwBE w])&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2011, DigiNotar, a Dutch SSL certificate company, incorrectly issued certificates to a malicious party or parties. Later on, it came to light that they were apparently compromised months before or perhaps even in May of 2009 if not earlier. Rogues certificates were issued for domains such as google.com, mozilla.org, torproject.org, login.yahoo.com and many more. &lt;ref&gt;Source: [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it The Tor Project: The DigiNotar Debacle, and what you should do about it] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyf0rpk w])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''This still leaves open the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack even when your browser is trusting an HTTPS connection.'''

There are alternatives to SSL, worth checking out if they may be useful for you. Unfortunately, they cannot be used as a drop-in replacement. Tools providing connection security include [http://web.monkeysphere.info/ Monkeysphere], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_%28SSL%29 Convergence], [http://perspectives-project.org/ Perspectives Project] and Tor hidden services&lt;ref&gt;[[Hidden Services]] are [[Hidden_Services#Notes_about_End-to-end_security_of_Hidden_Services|automatically encrypted end-to-end]]. (More specific: Tor to Tor)&lt;/ref&gt;.

On the one hand, by providing anonymity, Tor makes it more difficult to perform a man-in-the-middle attack targeted at '''one specific person''' with the blessing of a rogue SSL certificate. But on the other hand, Tor makes it easier for people or organizations running exit relays to perform large scale MitM attempts, or attacks targeted at '''a specific server''', and especially those among its users who happen to use Tor.

In all cases, you are advised to use additional message encryption for encrypting your mails, chats and so on. Tools such as encrypted messengers (Covered on the [[Chat]] page.), GPG [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard (wikipedia)], [[Software#Encrypt.2C_decrypt.2C_sign.2C_and_verify_text_using_OpenPGP.3B_GnuPG_frontend | KGpg]] and [[E-Mail | Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy]] and enigmail (gpg add-on) may be useful.

&lt;ref&gt; Quoted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack wikipedia Man-in-the-middle_attack] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyk0IKX w]) and [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/detecting-certificate-authority-compromises-and-web-browser-collusion Tor Project: Detecting Certificate Authority compromises and web browser collusion] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUykcmES w]). &lt;/ref&gt;

= Confirmation attacks =
Quoted from Tor Project: &quot;One cell is enough to break Tor's anonymity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyo9u9N&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Tor design doesn't try to protect against an attacker who can see or measure both traffic going into the Tor network and also traffic coming out of the Tor network. That's because if you can see both flows, some simple statistics let you decide whether they match up.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
That could also be the case if your ISP (or your local network administrator) and the ISP of the destination server (or the destination server itself) cooperate to attack you.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tor tries to protect against traffic analysis, where an attacker tries to learn whom to investigate, but Tor can't protect against traffic confirmation (also known as end-to-end correlation), where an attacker tries to confirm an hypothesis by monitoring the right locations in the network and then doing the math.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

= Whonix doesn't encrypt your documents by default =

The documents that you might save inside Whonix will not be encrypted by default. The [[Advanced Security Guide]] recommends [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Full_Disk_Encryption | to fully encrypt the host]].

It is likely that the files you may create will keep tracks that they were created using Whonix. (Under research.)

= Whonix is not amnesic =
Other than Tails, Whonix is not an Amnesic Live CD. If you install Whonix on your computer this will leave local traces on the harddrive, that you installed Whonix on that device. Any files you create will still exist after powering off or rebooting unless you securely wiped all signs of their previous existence.

There are no special measures to limit what is written to disk. This includes (non exclusive list) user created files, backup files, temporary files, swap, chat history, browser history and so on. Whonix acts like an ordinary installed operating system. It can also not be prevented, that the host memory [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap swaps] to the host disk. There is a [[SecurityGuide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots | Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots]] and it is [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Full_Disk_Encryption | recommended to apply Full Disk Encryption on the host]].

For more information on this topic, see also: [[FAQ#Is_there_a_substitute_for_Whonix.27s_lack_of_an_Amnesic_feature_.2F_Live_CD.2FDVD.3F_Forensics.3F|Is there a substitute for Whonix's lack of an Amnesic feature / Live CD/DVD? Forensics?]]&quot;

= Whonix doesn't clear the metadata of your documents =

Numerous files format store hidden data or metadata inside of the files. Text processors or PDF files could store the name of the author, the date and time of creation of the file, and sometimes even parts of the editing history of the fileâ€¦ those hidden data depend on the file format and the software used.

Images file formats, like TIFF of JPEG, probably take the prize in this field. Those files, created by digital cameras or mobile phones, contain a metadata format called EXIF which can include the date, time and sometimes the GPS coordinates of the picture, the brand and serial number of the device which took it as well as a thumbnail of the original image. Image processing software tend to keep those data intact. The internet is full of cropped or blurred images for which the EXIF thumbnail still contains the full original picture.

'''Whonix doesn't clear the metadata of your files for you'''. Yet, it's still within the Whonix' design goal to help you do that. For example, Whonix already comes with [[Metadata |  MAT]], which is a Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit.

= Whonix doesn't encrypt the Subject: and other headers of your encrypted e-mail messages =

Please note that the Subject: as well as the rest of the header lines of your OpenPGP encrypted e-mail messages are not encrypted. This is not a bug of Whonix or the [http://www.mozilla-enigmail.org/forum%20viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=328 OpenPGP] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyt6L0f w]) protocol; it's for backwards compatibility with the original SMTP protocol. Unfortunately no RFC standard exists yet for Subject encryption.

If you are looking for an e-mail client supporting OpenPGP encryption (enigmail), [[E-Mail | Mozilla Thunderbird with TorBirdy]] is recommended.

= Tor doesn't protect you from a global adversary =

A global passive adversary would be a person or an entity able to monitor at the same time the traffic between all the computers in a network. By studying, for example, the timing and volume patterns of the different communications across the network, it would be statistically possible to identify Tor circuits and thus matching Tor users and destination servers.

It is part of Tor's initial trade-off not to address such a threat in order to create a low-latency communication service usable for web browsing, Internet chat or SSH connections.

For more expert information see [https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf Tor Project: The Second-Generation Onion Router], ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUyv297d w]) part 3. Design goals and assumptions.

= Whonix doesn't magically separate your different contextual identities =

It is usually not advisable to use the same Whonix-Workstation to perform two tasks or endorse two contextual identities that you really want to keep separate from another. For example hiding your location to check your email and publishing anonymously a document.

First, because Tor tends to reuse the same circuits, for example amongst a same browsing session. Since the exit relay of a circuit knows both the destination server (and possibly the content of the communication if not encrypted) and the address of the previous relay it received the communication from, it makes it easier to correlate the several browsing requests as part of a same circuit and possibly made by a same user. If you are facing a global adversary as described above, it might then also be in position to do this correlation.

Second, in case of a security hole or a misuse in using Whonix or one of its application, information about that Whonix-Workstation could be leaked. That could reveal that the same person was behind the various actions made inside that Whonix-Workstation.

'''The solution to both threats is either following the [[SecurityGuide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots | Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots]] and/or to [[Multiple_Whonix-Workstations | use multiple Whonix-Workstations]]''' every time you're using a new identity, if you really want to isolate them better.

[[TorController | arm's]] &quot;New Identity&quot; button forces Tor to use new circuits but only for new connections: existing connections might stay open. Plus, apart from the Tor circuits, other kind of information can reveal your past activities, for example the cookies stored by your browser. So this feature of arm is not a solution to really separate contextual identities.

= Whonix doesn't make your crappy passwords stronger =

Tor allows you to be anonymous online; Whonix ensures that the whole operating system is forced through Tor (and many other extra Security features, see [Design]). But again, '''neither of both are magic spells for computer security'''.

If you use weak passwords, they can be guessed by brute-force attacks with or without Whonix in the same way. To know if your passwords are weak and learn good practices to create better password, you can read [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Examples_of_weak_passwords Wikipedia: Weak Passwords] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUz4uxz8 w]).

= Whonix doesn't secure your host =

Whonix can only be as secure as the host is. Of course you can simply use Whonix on top of your every day operating system as probably many people do. You will be much safer if you follow the [[Pre_Install_Advice#Recommendation_to_use_a_dedicated_host_operating_system | Recommendation to use a dedicated host operating system]].

= Only Whonix-Workstation is designed for anonymous activity =

Easy: All anonymous activity should only happen inside Whonix-Workstation. Nowhere else.

Explanation: The host operating system (the operating system running VirtualBox, the system you used before ever downloading Whonix) will NOT be torified. Never do any anonymous tasks on your host.

The Whonix-Gateway's only purpose is running Tor and the firewall. In most cases there is no need to modify things on the Gateway. Minor modifications such as setting up bridges are documented.

= Whonix doesn't improve security/anonymity outside of Whonix =

Obviously, Whonix can't stop people from looking over your shoulder or stop (mobile) providers from pinpointing your location if you gave it to a website for (mobile) phone verification.

= Whonix doesn't prevent you from shooting your own feet =

If you login to your personal Facebook account, which is bound to your real name, you are obviously not anonymous!

This will be substantiated on the later page [[DoNot | Non technical steps staying anonymous]].

= Whonix doesn't defeat Stylometry =

Whonix does not obfuscate your writing style.

This will be substantiated on the later page [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging | Anonymous Surfing, Posting and Blogging]].

= Whonix does not protect against social engineering. =
Whonix does not protect against social engineering&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29&lt;/ref&gt; hacks. One example of such a hack would be convincing you to send a copy of your logs from the Whonix-Gateway. Another example would be convincing you to give away logs/information about your host machine. The best tool in maintaining anonymity is knowledge that comes from research and experience.

= Whonix does not (yet)... =

Whonix is currently alpha quality software and missing features, some of them security related. Some of the following will probably never get &quot;fixed&quot; or implemented because they are impossible to do in a software only project.

Whonix in its current form does not:

* Encrypt your stuff.
* Wipe RAM on shut down. See [http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/30076/ Idea #30076: Enhancy Privacy/Security, Wipe RAM on shut down, reboot and trigger].
* Wipe video RAM on shut down. See [https://tails.boum.org/todo/erase_video_memory_on_shutdown/ Tails -erase video memory on shutdown].
* Make weak passwords stronger.
* Protect against local adversaries, who for example can mount cold boot and evil maid attacks.
* Protect you if you don't read our [[Documentation]] or do stupid things or change default settings without knowing what you are doing.
* Automatically apply security updates. This was a conscious decision because automated updates also come with their own set of security problems. However, you will be notified about updates on Whonix-Workstation by whonixcheck.
* Protect against global network adversaries.
* Protect against hardware or software backdoors.
* Automatically protect against MAC address fingerprinting on public networks.
* Protect against the more skilled software attacks, unless you use [PhysicalIsolation].
* By default, protect you if Tor is somehow broken. You can improve that to some extent (with caveats) by chaining Tor with SSH, proxies or VPNs.
* By default, hide the fact that you are using Tor, though there is an optional feature, [[Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP | Hide the fact you are using Tor/Whonix]].
* Use all the possible hardening options like full PIE and grsecurity. It doesn't use AppArmor profiles for everything.
* Obfuscate your writing style, defeat Stylometry.
* Have deterministic builds, see [[Dev/Archived Discussions]]. Also Tor itself does not have deterministic builds yet, see [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3688 Bug 3688].
* This list might be incomplete. Please read the rest of the [[Documentation]] (and perhaps [[Design]] as well) to if you want an overview about security, what's in and what not.

If you want to help us improve the security of Whonix, please join the discussions on [[Dev/Archived Discussions]] or on the developer mailing list.

= Whonix is a work in progress =

Whonix, as well as all the software it includes, are under continuous development and might contain programming errors or security holes. [[Download#Stay_tuned | Stay tuned]] to Whonix development. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.

The basic functionality is ready. You can use Whonix to browse the web and [[Hidden Services | host hidden services]], use email, IRC, ssh, etc. Development is still ongoing and more features are being added to Whonix. If you want join the development process or want to see what issues are still open, see our [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues Whonix github issues tracker].

From [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-October/025921.html Whonix 0.4.5 release announcement] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6EUzBC5nH w]):

&lt;pre&gt;
 Whonix uses the best of both worlds, the Isolating Proxy concept [2]
and the Transparent Proxy concept. At the moment there are no known
anonymity leaks or proxy bypass problems. The principal design is less
vulnerable for any kind of leaks. At time of writing (October 2012) I
have been working on the theoretical concept and practical
implementation for 9 months, the basics have been developed by (at
least) three people, adrelanos, smarm and anonymous. [1] [2]

  Although Whonix has been developed with greatest care, a negative,
being leak free or being free from mistakes in the extended project
description [1], can not be proven. This is Whonix's first release
announcement. I hope skilled people look into the concept and
implementation and fail to find anonymity related bugs.&lt;/pre&gt;

Furthermore you will be automatically notified about new Whonix versions by {{Code|Whonix Version Check}} and about the most important occurrences&lt;ref&gt;Such as when a version becomes unsupported, if manual action is required, if major features break, or if security vulnerabilities are found.

Use the official instructions in the Wiki - https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation

= 7.7.8.7 Build Documentation (short) =

This is a short set of instructions for building 7.7.8.7 testers-only version of Whonix (later to be modified for Whonix 8) inside VirtualBox (as opposed to the traditional process of running these commands on a system that is installed directly on the hardware).

Advantages of this approach are that you can build Whonix on any OS that can run VirtualBox (you need Debian Stable for hardware type build) and that any potential system damage is limited to the VM. Using shapshots you can quickly revert a faulty state or a failed build and start again.

The focus here is to show the simplest way to build Whonix from source. Various security precautions such as GPG key verification are omitted.

Please read the full [[Dev/BuildDocumentation_8#Build_Documentation.|documentation]] in order to understand the process better.

== Get and prepare Debian and VirtualBox ==
[[Debian#Download_and_Verification|Download and verify]] Debian Stable/Wheezy 32 bit network install (netinst) ISO.

[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads Download] the latest version of VirtualBox and verify the downloaded packages by [http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/virtualbox/4.3.6/SHA256SUMS comparing SHA256 checksums].

After you install VirtualBox create a new virtual machine with the following specifics:

&lt;pre&gt;
Name: Debian
Type: Linux
Version: Debian
Memory size: (go with recommended memory size) / Next
Hard Drive: Create a virtual hard drive now / Create
Hard drive file type: VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) / Next
Storage on physical hard drive: Dynamically allocated / Next
File location and size: 50 GB / Create
&lt;/pre&gt;

Start the newly created virtual machine, select the ISO of Debian 7.4 stable (debian-7.4.0-i386-netinst.iso) and click Start.

&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;

== VM Creation ==

Build a Whonix-Gateway virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-gateway 
&lt;/pre&gt;


Build a Whonix-Workstation virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

The resulting {{Code2|.ova}} images can be found in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} folder.


If you want to create a log of the build process (very useful for debugging) use the following commands but be aware that all output will be redirected to a file, meaning nothing will appear on the screen. This will create a text log in /home/user/log. 


For Workstation

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./nothing-to-see/whonix_build --build --tor-workstation &gt;&gt; /home/user/log-workstation 2&gt;&gt; /home/user/log-workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

For Gateway

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./nothing-to-see/whonix_build --build --tor-gateway &gt;&gt; /home/user/log-gateway 2&gt;&gt; /home/user/log-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
'''OPTIONAL.'''

If you are interested in seeing a visual walk-through of the VM creation, click on Expand on the right.

&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;

Enter the Gateway build command

[[File:16b.png|400px]]


Provide sudo password

[[File:18b.png|400px]]
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

== VM image export == 

After a few hours (depending on your disk speed, CPU clock rate, available download bandwidth, ...) the image (either Workstation or Gateway) will be created in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} directory. This will take from 3 to 7 hours per image.

You need to export the OVA image and then [[Install  |use it in VirtualBox]].

To transfer the images you can use VirtualBox's Shared Folders Functionality or USB transfer.  

==== Export to a shared folder ====   

To use shared folder functionality you must have [[VirtualBox_Guest_Additions|Guest Additions]] installed.

Before installing Guest Additions read the [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html official manual page] and Whonix's [[VirtualBox_Guest_Additions|wiki page]].

If you still want to use it, [http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.6/ download the ISO] (VBoxGuestAdditions_4.3.6.iso) and set up folder as described in the manual.

==== Export via USB ====

Unless you install VirtualBox Extension Pack, USB 2.0 won't be supported. USB 1.1 transfer speed is very low, usually 0,5 - 1 MB/s.

===== Extension pack install (optional) =====
Before installing the extension pack read the [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#intro-installing official manual page].

To proceed, [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads download] the vbox file (Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.3.6-91406.vbox-extpack). Import the file in VirtualBox (File/Preferences/Extensions then locate the file). After installing, &quot;Oracle VM VirtualBOx Extension Pack&quot; entry will appear as &quot;Active&quot;, resulting in a green arrow icon in front of the name.

===== USB transfer=====
Make your USB key available to the VM through selecting it in the Devices/USB devices menu. Plug it in first of course ;)

&lt;pre&gt;
## Install usbmount that will automatically mount your USB to media/usb0
sudo apt-get install usbmount

## Check if the USB is present and mounted
cd /media/usb0

## Copy the OVA file to USB. 
sudo cp /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Workstation-7.7.8.7.ova /media/usb0

## or if you have been building the Gateway
sudo cp /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Gateway-7.7.8.7.ova /media/usb0

## Unmount the USB
sudo umount /media/usb0
&lt;/pre&gt;

Deselect your USB key in the VM's Devices/USB devices menu to make it available to your host system again.

== Finishing up == 

You are done! OVA file is now on your USB key/in your shared folder. All you have to do is [[Install  |use it in VirtualBox]].

If you want to build another image (presuming you have build only Workstation or Gateway this time) revert the VM state to [[Jekyll:Sandbox#Building_from_source|Snapshot 2]].

From there follow the steps as you previously did and build the image you still need Workstation or Gateway.</text>

== What is KVM? ==
For an openly developed, FOSS GPL licensed hypervisor, it is recommended you use KVM [Kernel Virtual Machine] that comes with the GNU/Linux OS. KVM combined with the VirtualMachineManager front-end should provide a familiar and intuitive, easy to use GUI.

For a detailed view on its security merits read the report issued by an independent security auditing firm: http://www.atsec.com/downloads/white-papers/kvm_security_comparison.pdf

== Why Use KVM Over VirtualBox? ==
Recently, the VirtualBox developer team have taken the decision to switch out the BIOS in their hypervisor with one that requires compilation by a toolchain that does not meet the definition of Free Software as per the guidelines of the Free Software Foundation. This move has been deemed problematic for free and open source software projects like Debian, on which Whonix is based. https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Virtualization_Platform#VirtualBox_no_longer_in_Debian_mai...

The issues of the Open Watcom License are explained in this thread on the Debian Mailinglist: http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-legal@lists.debian.org/msg34687.html and can be summarized as issues surrounding the contradictory language of the license, the assertion of patents against software that relies on it and the placing of certain restrictions on uses of the software.

For those who care about running Free Software and appreciate its ethical views, it is recommended that you avoid running VirtualBox, for that reason alone if nothing else.

Besides this licensing issue which may or may not be of concern to users, a more tangible reason can be the security practices of Oracle, the corporation behind VirtualBox. Recent events and news (see Snowden leaks) have shown the urgent need for increased transparency and trust in the digital world. Oracle is infamous for their lack of transparency in disclosing security bugs details and for discouraging public full disclosure by third parties.
http://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/vulnerability-remediation/disclosure/index.html &lt;&lt; security through obscurity is the modus operandi at Oracle.
http://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/vulnerability-remediation/reporting-security-vu... &lt;&lt; Oracle calls it &quot;responsible disclosure&quot; which is actually security through obscurity. Not going public with a vulnerability and its details only leads to laziness and complacency on part of the company that fields the affected products.
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Apr/343 &lt;&lt; A 0day reported privately to Oracle in 2008 by an independent security researcher has remained unfixed as of 2012 when this post was written.

Furthermore VirtualBox contains significant functionality that is only available as a proprietary extension, such as USB and PCI passthrough and RDP connectivity. Seeing Oracle's unfriendly trackrecord with the free software community in the past; examples include OpenSolaris and OpenOffice, it would not be a strecth to imagine them charging money for the closed up features at some point in the future or simply abandoning the project if they cannot monetize it to their liking.

It is highly recommended you use the GUI VirtualMachineManager package to configure your vm for simplicity and ease of use.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install virt-manager
&lt;/pre&gt;

3. Before starting the new vm wizard we must create an internal isolated network that connects the workstation with the gateway.

Go to the VMM GUI --&gt; Edit --&gt; Connection Details --&gt; Add button
Choose whonix as network name
Edit subnet range to 10.0.0.2/24
Uncheck the dhcpv4 option
Ignore anything to do with ipv6
Keep the default option of: Isolated Virtual Network selected and click finish.

The next steps may need more work to customize vm devices and clock to safe defaults. Work in this area not final.

4. Create a Whonix Gateway vm first and choose to edit it before installation.
Customize the first NIC that is included to be in default NAT mode.
Click to add hardware and chose another NIC.
This new NIC must have the newly created isolated virtual network 'whonix' selected as the network device. Finalize and launch.
Must enable disk controller as SATA
Must select qcow2 as storage format.

5. Create Whonix Workstation vm and  make sure you select the isolated int. network for the only NIC this machine has. Launch.
Disk Controller works only with IDE
Must select qcow2 as storage format

Don't forget to take snapshot.

Done!

-SPICE is enabled for graphics by default but needs a vdagent to be installed in the guest vms for accelerated 2D in vm to happen. Not included in workstation install by default which impacts performance greatly.

http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/SPICE

It should be safe for use unless you Adrelanos determine otherwise. 2D and 3D in VBox have an insecure architecture and even the manuals admit to this. 2D in VBox is not even available for anything but windows guests which is not recommended and insecure of course.  Everything Linux based is designed from the ground up with security considerations in mind.

Clock disabling for vms on host is recommended by Adrelanos. Still haven't done it yet,  and it seems to need command line.

== Enabling SPICE == 
SPICE allows accelerated graphics and clipboard sharing. Its implications for security are an open question that needs a detailed answer rather than a vague clear cut one.

1. Enable SPICE by selecting it from the VMM GUI. (It is the default option if you decide not select VNC when creating the VM).
 
Not enabling SPICE from the beginning, will prevent the spice channel device from being added which impacts performance. To fix this add a channel device and select SPICE. This steps is not necessary if you leave the defaults as they are at the beginning.

2. QXL is the GPU model that should be attached.

3. Install vdagent in guest and reboot.

The OpenPGP Web of Trust

If you want to be extra cautious and really authenticate a OpenPGP key in a stronger way than what standard HTTPS offers you, you could use the OpenPGP Web of Trust.

One of the inherent problems of standard HTTPS is that the trust we usually put on a website is defined by certificate authorities: a hierarchical and closed set of companies and governmental institutions approved by web browser vendors. This model of trust has long been criticized and proved several times to be vulnerable to attacks as explained on our warning page.

We believe instead that users should be given the final say when trusting a website, and that designation of trust should be done on the basis of human interaction.

The OpenPGP Web of Trust is a decentralized trust model based on OpenPGP keys. Let's see that with an example.

You're a friend of Alice and really trust her way of managing OpenPGP keys. You've validated Alice's key.
Furthermore, Alice met Bob in a conference, and signed Bob's key.

This scenario creates a trust path from you to Bob's key that could allow you to validate it without having to depend on certificate authorities.

This trust model is not perfect either and requires both caution and intelligent supervision by users. The technical details of creating, managing and trusting OpenPGP keys are outside of the scope of this document.

We also acknowledge that not everybody might be able to create good trust path since it based on a network of direct human relationships and the knowledge of quite complex tools such as GnuPG.

Because Whonix developer adrelanos prefers to stay anonymous, this trust model is not suited for Whonix.

Introduction

The high level overview of this concept is as follows:
Shut down your every day operating system. Boot your air gapped operating system. You can boot a Live DVD or an operating system installed on external media such as USB (recommendation: use full disk encryption). Using a separate physical hardware is better than just booting another operating system, but still, using another operating system is better than nothing.
By default GPG creates a signing key as your main key (your identity) and one encryption subkey (how you receive messages intended for you). We will only create a primary singing/certification key.
Use GPG to add an additional encryption and signing subkey to your keypair. These new subkeys are linked to your main key. Now we have two subkeys. Store the whole key in a protected place. Your master keypair is the one whose compromise would be truly catastrophic.
Then create a slave key which won't contain your master key.
Copy your slave key to your every day operating system.


Prerequisites

It is recommended to first quickly read this article from top to bottom without taking actions. After you roughly understood how it's supposed to work, re-read this page and do it step-by-step. Exercise this with test keys first. If that works, consider doing this with your primary keys.
Make backups of your existing GnuPG files ($HOME/.gnupg). Keep them safe. If something goes wrong during the following steps, you may need this to return to a known good place.
You should know how to boot other operating systems than your primary every day operating system from Live DVD and/or other external media such as USB.
Optionally, if your storage medium could get accessed or stolen by an adversary, it is also recommended to learn how to use disk encryption software. As a precaution, it's wise to do this anyway.
Additionally to protect yourself against mistakes it may make sense to manage your gpg master key folder with a version revision system such as git.


Creating your Air Gapped OpenPGP Key

Preparation

Boot your air gapped system.
mkdir ~/gpg-master
mkdir ~/.gnupg
chmod 700 ~/gpg-master
chmod 700 ~/.gnupg
Create a ~/gpg-master/gpg.conf and ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf. Source: gpg.conf optimized for privacy Check if there is a newer version available. It probably makes sense to copy that file to an USB stick beforehand so you don't have to type it by hand.

Creating your Initial Keypair

Use the gpg ââgen-key command to create a new GPG keypair.
When you create your new keypair, use the highest possible values for key length. As computers get more powerful and storage gets cheaper, itâs conceivable that a nasty person could archive a message thatâs unbreakable today, then in the future break it using a more powerful computer. Using the highest possible value for key length helps protect you from that scenario. Donât use GPGâs default of 2048!
To prevent filling up the keyserver with garbage and outdated keys or if something goes wrong, it's recommended to set an expire data on your key.
When prompted for a passphrase, make sure to pick a long and unique one. It will be your passphrase for your master key. (We'll later set a different passphrase for your slave key.) If your key gets stolen, this passphrase is the only thing protecting it! Don't use a passphrase you've ever used on your every day operating system, because that will help you to store a backup of your private master key on your every day operating system and thanks to the passphrase protection, you can even back it up in places without strong guarantees of privacy such as free cloud hosting or you public homepage. Just remember, to never enter the passphrase on your every day operating system.

gpg&gt; save


Exporting your Master Key

Now that your keypair has been created, letâs export it so that we can back it up:
gpg --homedir ~/gpg-master --armor --export-secret-keys 0x2516E552C8D4D937 &gt; 0x2516E552C8D4D937.private.gpg-key
gpg --homedir ~/gpg-master --armor --export 0x2516E552C8D4D937 &gt; 0x2516E552C8D4D937.public.gpg-key
This will create two files: your public key and your private key. Backup these two files, as best as you can.


Creating your Slave Key

Export Secret Subkeys

Now we have our master keypair in our keyring, along with two files representing the master keypair plus the keypairâs revocation certificate. To derive our slave keypair from our master keypair, we have to create a copy of our master keypair and remove the master secret key.
Export all of the subkeys from our new keypair to a file:
gpg --homedir ~/gpg-master --armor --export-secret-subkeys 0x2516E552C8D4D937 &gt; subkeys


Create your Slave Key without Master Key

We are now no longer using --homedir ~/gpg-master!
Re-import the sub keys we exported.
gpg --import subkeys
Clean up our temporary file.
rm subkeys
Re-import our public key we exported.
gpg --import 0x2516E552C8D4D937.public.gpg-key
Set a new password for your slave key. Remember, you'll have two different passwords. One for your master key, one for your slave key.
gpg --edit-key 0x2516E552C8D4D937
passwd
...
save
Thatâs all! You can verify it worked by running:

gpg --list-secret-keys
/home/user/gpg-slave/secring.gpg
- -----------------------------
sec#  4096R/488BA441 2013-03-13
uid                  Bilbo Baggins &lt;bilbo@shire.org&gt;
ssb   4096R/69B0EA85 2013-03-13
ssb   4096R/C24C2CDA 2013-03-13
See how the third line begins with âsec#â, not âsecâ? The pound sign means the signing subkey is not in the keypair located in the keyring. Or more correctly said, see footnote. [1]
To make sure everything is alright, use switch gpg's homedir to ~/gpg-master and see if the secret master key is available.
Store your slave key in a file.
gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys 0x2516E552C8D4D937 &gt; 0x2516E552C8D4D937.secret-subkeys.gpg-key
You can now copy your public key, master key and slave key to a disk and import your public key and your slave key to your every day operating system(s).


In Case of Emergency

Should the worst happen and your slave keypair gets lost, compromised or stolen, we need to revoke the subkeys on that keypair.
Unlock your safe-deposit box and get your master keypair out.
Boot a live USB of Debian or your distro of choice. Then, import your master keypair into the live USBâs keyring:

gpg --import /path/to/0x2516E552C8D4D937.public.gpg-key /path/to/0x2516E552C8D4D937.private.gpg-key

Other Interesting Stuff

Backups

Make sure you always have a backup of your master key in case one USB stick breaks down. Maybe you like to use paperkey (in debian) for that purpose.


Smartcards

You can then use the smartcard on your everyday system without risk of &gt; exposing the private keys (i.e. they cannot br copied from the smartcard but it is possible to abuse them on the smartcard which can cause less but severe damage, too). Smartcards are worth checking out, but outside the scope of this guide.


Security Considerations

You can skip this if you are not interested in this! This is just a justification why we do things as we do.
Alex Cabal's original text recommends to use gpg --delete-secret-key. We're not using this for two reasons.
Securely wiping of data is a difficult issue. We believe it is safer to create a new keypair (a new secring.gpg) than trusting gpg to remove the private master key from secring.gpg. This is just an assumption, could be FUD.
Users may confuse the gpg-master homedir from their gpg-slave homedir after using like ten times the gpg-master homedir. When they don't carefully read, they could accidentally delete their master key.
Our every day operating system never gets to see our OpenPGP master key, because we regard our every day operating system to be untrusted for these purposes.
Alex Cabal's original text uses gpg e-mail@address, we're using short key ids to avoid user mistakes when editing more complex keys.
Alex Cabal's original text uses gpg setpref and we're using a gpg config file to have these settings enforced already during key creation.

How to adjust KVM to have clock=vm on host.

See http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/KVMClock

ls /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource

To ensure that you have successfully isolated the vm clock form the host's you must run this in the vm:

sudo chmod -x /etc/init.d/sdwdate

You should verify then that no time changes on the host affect the vm.

== Instructions include how to set clock to UTC? ==
How to use -rtc clock=vm ?

== Weaker warning against KVM in whonixcheck ==
As soon as all blockers have been sorted out. We could recommend using [[KVM]] instructions.

== qcow2 compression ==
There is a minor issue with the new extra qcow2 images, which are now preallocated. Upload would take ~250 hours per image. Looks like they're not [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file sparse files] anymore. I'll manually compress and upload them. No need for a new tag, no need to delay the release further.

How to check if virtio storage access is in use or an eventually existing fallback driver?

== How to check if virtio network is really in use or an eventually existing fallback driver? ==
/sys/devices/virtio-pci/0/net/eth0/statistics/rx_bytes seems not to exist on Debian Wheezy.

== How to enable AppArmor / SELinux for KVM on Debian? ==

Details on how to install, configure and enable SELinux enforcing mode:
https://wiki.debian.org/SELinux/Setup#Steps_to_setup_SELinux &lt;-- This is a start, but incomplete. When following these instructions it gets difficult at the &quot;audit2why -al&quot; step, because it shows a ton of policy violations which are non-trivial to fix without learning a lot about SELinux.

== How to add a random time offset? ==
Having a small random offset (similar to [[Advanced_Security_Guide#Network_Time_Synchronization]]) would be a good thing.

== Is it possible to add 64, 128 or even more MB to the virtual graphics card using the command line to boost graphics performance? ==

Yes. Can be realised by virsh command as per the steps in here:
http://serverfault.com/questions/346301/how-to-increase-video-memory-in-libvirt-kvm-gui

== Script/automate creation of VM description files? ==
So not following manual instructions is required anymore, but copy/paste some commands end up with the correct VM configuration.

== Script/automate creation and upload of raw images? ==
Because raw images have better performance than raw images? http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Qcow2

True that performance is better, but I don't think it supports snapshots AFAIK.
For something that supports snapshots and has better performance than qcow2 there is QED. A format developed by IBM for the QEMU project recently, that promises just that.

== Set cluster_size 512 - 2MB for better performance? ==
HulaHoop1 wrote: The qcow2 defaults seem fine to me, however the one parameter of interest we should play with is image's : 'cluster_size' 512 - 2MB the larger the size the better performance but the size is bigger. I think we should try the largest and see if the image size stays reasonable.

du -h file.img &lt;br /&gt;
2,9 GB

File size grew a bit. Not too much. We could use this.

It remains to be tested, if the images work well using these settings. (The apparent size should be shown as 100 GB, but is only 2,9 GB. Needs testing if 100 GB can be used after the image is in use.)

&quot;qemu-img info file.img&quot; however, shows 2,9 GB actual size and 100 GB virtual size.

git tag 7.8.0.1 and above will be using the &quot;-o cluster_size=2M&quot; option.

As per [http://www.ilsistemista.net/index.php/virtualization/11-kvm-io-slowness-on-rhel-6.html?start=7 blog post] it is recommended to use a no cache policy. Do our KVM instructions need changes to incorporate this?

|description=Development Notes about File System Permissions
}}

Whonix developer adrelanos doesn't believe in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions file system permissions] for containing malware having already infected a system and shares Joanna Rutkowska's opinion on that. The word &quot;believe&quot; in this context has been deliberately chosen, because putting permissions into questions might start a religiously heated discussion.

[http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2013/06/qubes-os-r3-alpha-preview-odyssey-hal.html Quote Joanna Rutkowska] (computer security researched; Qubes OS developer; ...; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Rutkowska wikipedia]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[...] &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One interesting thing about Qubes DB is that it get rids of the (overly complex and unnecessary) permission system that is used by xenstore, and instead uses the most simple approach: each VM has its separate Qubes DB daemon, and so a totally separate configuration/state namespace. This is inline with the rest of the Qubes philosophy, which basically says that: '''permissions is dead, long live separation!''' &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many old-school security people can't imagine a system without permissions, but if we think about it more, we might get to a conclusion that: 1) permissions are complex and so often difficult to understand and set correctly, 2) require often complex code to parse and make security decisions, and 3) often are absolutely unneeded. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a practical example of how permissions schemes might sometime trick even (otherwise somehow smart) developers into making a mistake consider [http://git.qubes-os.org/?p=joanna/core-admin.git;a=commitdiff;h=59f71f634af596c8fe2ef507509bf1ae850286c7 this bug] in Qubes we made a long time ago when setting permissions on some xenstore key, which resulted in some information leak (not much of a security problem in general, but still). And just today, Xen.org has published [http://lists.xenproject.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2013-06/msg02123.html this advisory], that sounds pretty serious, again caused by bad permissions on some xenstore keys. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[...]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The real solution is using strong isolation concepts, as Qubes OS is doing.

Countless hours of Whonix development time were wasted on file permissions.

|description=How to use Other Desktop Environments other than KDE with Whonix
}}

= Current Situation =
[[Download]]able Whonix versions come with KDE installed by default. It is possible to uninstall KDE, although doing so is a bit difficult, especially if you want to uninstall all of it and/or to to use a CLI version and/or to install their own desktop environment such as Gnome, LXDE, etc.

Users who build Whonix from source code using [[Dev/Build Documentation]] can use an optional Terminal-Only build configuration option. And then decide from there, if they want to install a desktop environment and which one.

= Risks =
When installing your own desktop environment, you're on your own. In theory (also tested a little bit), everything should work except Whonix's link open confirmation (asking for confirmation, if you want to open a link you click outside the browser in Tor Browser to avoid linking) and perhaps Tor Browser won't be the default browser.

Other desktop environments install other background services. We haven't researched the privacy implications of having these installed. For example, Gnome automatically installs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoClue GeoClue]. (Whonix prevents installation of that very package, but still...) And comes with a different collection of default applications that have not necessarily been checked for privacy. For example, Thunderbird/TorBirdy (as explained on the [[E-Mail]] page) is the only recommended mail client. Installing your own desktop environment may result in installing KMail, which isn't recommended, since there is no TorBirdy-like extension for KMail.

= Future =
At the moment unfortunately, &quot;Whonix should support other desktop environments&quot; is a synonym for &quot;adrelanos should support other desktop environments&quot;. Due to time constrains it won't be possible for Whonix developer adrelanos to maintain a second desktop environment next to maintaining the KDE desktop environment.

Since Whonix is an Open Source / Free Software project, Whonix developers are hoping that other developers join the project and maintain other desktop environments. That someone could be you.

      <comment>/* Serving the Mirror Content */ update config file name</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3978">Running a mirror for Whonix can be immensely helpful, but takes some knowledge, proper configuration and adequate resources to be truly useful.

== Requirements ==

* A server with a publicly accessibly IP address. You may already have one of these, but [http://lowendbox.com/ lowendbox] often has decent boxes at low prices. Look for ones with higher bandwidth caps, as you will be serving lots of data (~2.5GB for a download of Workstation+Gateway for Whonix 7). The load on your individual mirror will go down as more mirrors are added. If you exceed the allocated bandwidth, you may incur additional charges or even terminated service depending on your provider, so be careful, and overestimate on your bandwidth requirements.
* SSH root access to that server (sudo is fine)
* Recommended: Debian Wheezy as the operating system. You can use any distro you like, but this guide is written using Wheezy.

== Install Apache ==

# Install Apache:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install apache2
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will create the directory structure where we will put our mirrored copy of Whonix, as well as install Apache which will serve the mirrored content.

== Getting Whonix ==

Install rsync:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install rsync
&lt;/pre&gt;

and get Whonix from the rsync master:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo rsync -rtv rsync://rsync.whonix.org/whonix /var/www/whonix
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will put the contents of http://rsync.whonix.org/ in your server's directory /var/www/whonix.

== Automating updates from master ==

So your mirror will be up to date whenever a new version of Whonix is released, we will add an entry to the crontab to check for updates every hour:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo crontab -e
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will see the crontab opened in nano (at least on Wheezy 7.3). Hit &quot;Page Down&quot; or the down cursor key until you are on the last line (below &quot;m h  dom mon dow   command&quot;) and enter:
&lt;pre&gt;
  0 *   *   *   *    rsync -rt rsync://rsync.whonix.org/whonix /var/www/whonix
&lt;/pre&gt;

The numbers don't have to line up exactly with the heading, but it makes it easier to read.

== Serving the Mirror Content ==

Paste this into /etc/apache2/sites-available/mirror.whonix.org.conf:
&lt;pre&gt;
#
#  mirror.whonix.org (/etc/apache2/sites-available/mirror.whonix.org.conf)
#
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
        ServerAdmin &lt;YourContactEmail&gt;EDIT THIS
        ServerName  mirror.whonix.org
        DocumentRoot /var/www/whonix/
        # Logfile
        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/whonix/error.log
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;Modified from &lt;ref&gt;http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/412&lt;/ref&gt;
Make the directory for the new logs:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir /var/log/apache2/whonix
&lt;/pre&gt;
Once you filled in your contact email (it will throw errors otherwise), enable the site:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo a2ensite mirror.whonix.org.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;
You will be prompted to reload apache:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service apache2 reload
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Stripping User IPs ==

While the config file above does not have an access log, user IPs can still be logged in error.log. It is therefore recommended to install mod-removeip to make Apache &quot;blind&quot; to the IP addresses of users. Install it:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-removeip
&lt;/pre&gt;
Activate it:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo a2enmod removeip
&lt;/pre&gt;
and reload Apache
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo service apache2 restart
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Getting Your Mirror Added ==

Email the IP address of your new mirror to [[Contact#For_website_issues | Fortasse]], and you will be notified when it has been added to the rotation. Due to the way DNS propagates, it may be up to 24 hours before your system starts seeing traffic.

'''Thanks for your support!'''

== Optional Customization ==

You can customize the header and footer of your directory listing as explained [http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/118-how-to-display-a-standard-header-and-footer-on-directory-listings/ here]. Feel free to have something like &quot;Mirror provided by &lt;link to your blog or company&gt;&quot;, but please don't go overboard. Mirrors with blatant banner ads or user-tracking scripts will be rejected.

Wenn Nutzer Kommentare im Blog oder sonstige Beiträge hinterlassen, werden ihre IP-Adressen gespeichert. Das erfolgt zur Sicherheit des Anbieters, falls jemand in Kommentaren und Beiträgen widerrechtliche Inhalte schreibt (Beleidigungen, verbotene politische Propaganda, etc.). In diesem Fall kann der Anbieter selbst für den Kommentar oder Beitrag belangt werden und ist daher an der Identität des Verfassers interessiert.

Whonix ist ein Betriebssystem mit Fokus auf Anonymität, Privatsphäre und Sicherheit. Es basiert auf dem Tor Anonymitätsnetzwerk und Sicherheit durch Isolation. DNS Leaks sind unmöglich, nicht mal Malware mit Rootrechten kann die echte IP des Benutzers herausfinden.

Whonix besteht aus zwei Teilen: Auf einem läuft Tor und fungiert als ein Tunnel, diesen nennen wir Whonix-Gateway. Der andere, welchen wir Whonix-Workstation nennen befindet sich in einem völlig isolierten Netzwerk. Nur Verbindungen durch Tor sind möglich.

Um mehr über Sicherheit und Anonymität in Whonix zu lernen, fahren sie bitte fort zur Seite [[About|Über Whonix]].

'''OPTIONAL!'''

When building with --bare-metal option in a virtual machine, builders can use their own http proxy (apt cache) on the host, which will greatly improve build speed when building several times in a row (debugging, development).

If you are interested, click on Expand on the right.
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
This isn't required when you are building virtual machine images, because then apt-cacher-ng is automatically set up for you. Only useful when using --bare-metal in a virtual machine.

Requires Whonix 7.7.3.7 or above.

Example.

On the host.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install apt-cacher-ng
&lt;/pre&gt;

Be sure to have a firewall, so not the whole internet can use your apt-cacher-ng service.

Inside your Virtual Machine.

Don't forget to replace 192.168.0.1 with your host's internal IP (use &quot;sudo ifconfig&quot; on your host to find out what your internal IP is).

&lt;pre&gt;
export http_proxy=http://192.168.0.1:3142
&lt;/pre&gt;

Don't forget to add -E to sudo, so environment variables are preserved. Examples.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo -E ./whonix_build --bare-metal --tor-gateway --build
sudo -E ./build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine --bare-metal --tor-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[Image:whonix.jpg|center|Whonix Concept|500px]]

Whonix является операционной системой, нацеленной на обеспечение анонимности, приватности и безопасности данных. В её основе лежит Сеть Анонимизации Tor&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en&lt;/ref&gt;, Debian GNU/Linux&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian&lt;/ref&gt; и безопасность за счёт изоляции потоков. Утечки DNS-запросов невозможны, и даже программы-шпионы с правами корневого пользователя не способны выяснить реальный IP пользователя.

Whonix состоит из двух частей: первая обеспечивает соединение с/работу Tor и действует как шлюз, поэтому и называется Whonix-Gateway (Whonix-шлюз). Вторая, именуемая Whonix-Workstation (Whonix-Рабочая станция), находится в совершенно изолированной сети. Любые соединения возможны только через Tor.

Для получения дополнительной информации по безопасности данных и анонимности, обеспечиваемых в ОС Whonix, обратитесь к странице [[О|О Whonix]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="490">Whonix состоит из двух частей: первая обеспечивает соединение с/работу Tor и действует как шлюз, поэтому и называется Whonix-Gateway (Whonix-шлюз). Вторая, именуемая Whonix-Workstation (Whonix-Рабочая станция), находится в совершенно изолированной сети. Любые соединения возможны только через Tor.</text>

Образы Whonix для виртуальной машины криптографически подписаны OpenPGP &lt;ref&gt;OpenPGP является стандартом шифрования данных, обеспечивающим криптографическую приватность и идентификацию посредством использования ключей, находящихся у пользователей.&lt;/ref&gt; разработчиком Whonix.

Если вы знаете, как пользоваться ключом OpenPGP, сразу скачайте [[Whonix Signing Key]] и [[#Download Whonix|подписи Whonix]].

В противном случае следуйте следующим указаниям:

* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Linux|Для Linux: Ubuntu, Debian, Whonix, и др. с помощью kgpg]]
* [[Verify the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command line|Для Linux в командной строке]]
* [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_other_operating systems|Для Windows или Mac]]

= Install Whonix =

== 1. Before installing ==

Прочтите и используйте
[[Pre_Install_Advice|Советы по безопасности]].

== 2. Install ==

* Скачайте и установите [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads VirtualBox]. &lt;ref&gt;Или же можно найти и установить портативную сборку
VirtualBox&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[#Download Whonix|Загрузить Whonix]], после чего нужно импортировать оба образа Whonix&lt;ref&gt;Требуются ОБА образа: Whonix-Gateway.ova и
Whonix-Workstation.ova. Whonix состоит из двух виртуальных машин.&lt;/ref&gt; в VirtualBox. Не меняйте никакие настройки во время процесса импорта!
* Сделайте снимок системы в VirtualBox для обоих машин: для Whonix-Gateway и Whonix-Workstation. Позднее из этих снимков вы сможете в любое время с лёгкостью восстановить систему до первоначального состояния.

=== Need help? ===

There is a tutorial with screenshots, see [[Install|Install]].

There are also [[Videos|Video Tutorials]].

If you still need help, please check the [[Support|Support]] page.

== 3. After installing ==

Ознакомьтесь с/воспользуйтесь [[Post Install Advice|Советами по действиям после установки]].

=  Stay tuned =

== Introduction ==
Чтение свежих новостей позволит быть в курсе событий в отношении последних обстоятельств. В случае обнаружения уязвимостей в Whonix или выпуска улучшенной версии вы, таким образом, будете знать о них.

== Whonix News Blogs ==
[[File:Whonix News Blog opened offline created by adrelanos.png|thumb|alt=Whonix News Blogs Screenshot|Whonix News Blogs]]
There are two ways to get news. Choose at your preference.

# {{Code|Важный блог Whonix}} - Здесь публикуется наиболее важная
информация. Главным образом, это информация об уязвимостях и новых
стабильных версиях. Этот блог предназначен для людей с недостатком
времени или отсутствием интереса к разработке Whonix и связанным с ОС
новостям.
# {{Code|Блог функций Whonix}} - Включает в себя всю информацию из
{{Code|Важного блога Whonix}}. Рассматриваются только версии для
тестировщиков и разработчиков. Обновляется по мере наличия у
разработчника свободного времени. Содержит также информацию об
обновлениях статей, новых функциях, будущих функциях, разработке,
предложения к тестированию, общие мысли о проекте и тому подобное.

When you start '''Tor Browser Recommended''', there is a shortcut on the desktop, see [[Image:important.png|alt=Tor Browser Recommend Icon|r]] , it will open both Whonix News Blogs in a privacy friendly way. It's recommended at least to read Whonix Important Blog if you are in a hurry. Have a look into Whonix Feature Blog if you are generally interested to learn about anonymity/privacy/security related things or to see what's going on with Whonix.

== Operating System Updates ==
Необходимо регулярно проверять наличие обновлений для вашей основной (негостевой) операционной системы, Whonix-Workstation (Whonix-Рабочей станции) и Whonix-Gateway (Whonix-шлюза) в соответствии с рекомендациями  [[Security Guide|Руководства по безопасности]]

== Tor Browser ==
[[Image:whonixcheck_gui.png|alt=whonixcheck graphical user interface screenshot|[[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]]|thumb]]

There is no auto-update feature for Tor Browser. You will be notified about new Tor Browser versions by [[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]]. Tor Browser's built in update check mechanism also works in Whonix. For instructions how to update the browser, see [[Tor Browser|Tor Browser]]. Additionally it might also be wise to subscribe to https://blog.torproject.org for news.

== Whonix Version Check and Whonix News ==
[[File:whonixcheck created by adrelanos.png|alt=whonixcheck graphical user interface screnshot|thumb|Whonix Version Check (first rectangle in black) and&lt;br /&gt;Whonix News &lt;br /&gt;(second rectangle in green)]]
Furthermore you will be automatically notified about new Whonix versions by Whonix Version Check and about the most important occurrences&lt;ref&gt;Such as when a version becomes unsupported, if manual action is required, if major features break, or if security vulnerabilities are found. The policy is to use Whonix News as rarely as possible.&lt;/ref&gt; by Whonix News, both of which are part of [[whonixcheck|whonixcheck]].

== Social Media Profiles ==
Существует несколько [[Official Whonix Online Profiles|Групп Whonix в социальных сетях]], однако не полагайтесь на них в плане получения Новостей Whonix, и по мере возможности избегайте использовать их для связи с разработчиками Whonix.  (См. [[Contact|Контакты]] для получения контактной информации.)

Because some people will do so even though it is not recommended, messages from the Whonix Feature Blog will be automatically mirrored to [https://twitter.com/Whonix Whonix Twitter Profile], to [https://www.facebook.com/Whonix Whonix Facebook Profile] and to [https://plus.google.com/108150429836421683225/ Whonix Google+ Profile].

Если распространение вами информации о Whonix не несёт для вас никакой угрозы, можете свободно пользоваться этими группами и ставить им оценки &quot;нравится&quot; (используя анонимную учётную запись), чтобы [[Contribute|Внести вклад]] для поддержания ОС Whonix.

== Source Code ==
Если вас интересуют обновления исходного кода Whonix, [[Dev/git#subscribe_to_code_changes|подпишитесь на получение информации по изменениям в исходном коде]].

= Known bugs =

== Normal ==

=== Mounting (CD/DVD) Devices ===
You can use the following workaround.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom/
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following message.

&lt;pre&gt;
mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
&lt;/pre&gt;

Is expected. (It's normal that CD/DVD's are mounted read-only.)

Help fixing this bug is welcome!

=== VLC / Video Player Crash ===

You can use this workaround.
&lt;pre&gt;
VLC -&gt; Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Video -&gt; Output -&gt; X11 -&gt; Save
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Minor ==

=== &quot;apt-get source package&quot; will show &quot;dpkg-source: warning: failed to verify signature&quot; ===
More info [http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2013/08/msg00000.html here] (and in the following mails).

It is only a warning. If you want, you can get rid of it with the following workaround.

1. Modify &lt;code&gt;/etc/dpkg/origins/default&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/debian /etc/dpkg/origins/default
&lt;/pre&gt;

2. {{Code|apt-get source package}}

3. Undo afterwards to prevent unexpected issues.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo unlink /etc/dpkg/origins/default
sudo ln -s /etc/dpkg/origins/whonix /etc/dpkg/origins/default
&lt;/pre&gt;

Также, благодаря {{Code|Проверке версии Whonix}} вы будете получать автоматические уведомления о новых версиях и о самых важных событиях &lt;ref&gt;, например, о том, что версия перестала поддерживаться, или о том, что требуется какое-либо действие, перестали работать какие-либо функции или были обнаружены уязвимости в системе обеспечения безопасности. Согласно замыслу необходимость в пользовании {{Code|Новостями Whonix}} сведена к минимуму.&lt;/ref&gt; за счёт {{Code|Новостей Whonix}}, они являются частью [[whonixcheck|whonix-проверки]].</text>

=== Проблемы с соединением - После обновления Tor перестаёт работать и требуется обходное решение ===
При обновлении Tor до 0.2.4.19-1~d79.jessie+1 (командой sudo apt-get dist-upgrade), соединение с Tor может перестать работать. Существует временный метод обхода этой проблемы.</text>

|description=Instructions for building Whonix from Source Code inside a Virtual Machine.
}}

= Documentation =
This is a short set of instructions for building 7.7.9.8 testers-only version of Whonix (later to be modified for Whonix 8) inside VirtualBox (as opposed to the traditional process of running these commands on a system that is installed directly on the hardware).

Advantages of this approach are that you can build Whonix on any OS that can run VirtualBox (you need Debian Stable for hardware type build) and that any potential system damage is limited to the VM. Using shapshots you can quickly revert a faulty state or a failed build and start again.

The focus here is to show the simplest way to build Whonix from source. Various security precautions such as GPG key verification are omitted.

Please read the full [[Dev/BuildDocumentation_8#Build_Documentation.|documentation]] in order to understand the process better.

== Get and prepare Debian and VirtualBox ==
[[Debian#Download_and_Verification|Download and verify]] Debian Stable/Wheezy 32 bit network install (netinst) ISO.

[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads Download] the latest version of VirtualBox and verify the downloaded packages by [http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/virtualbox/4.3.6/SHA256SUMS comparing SHA256 checksums].

After you install VirtualBox create a new virtual machine with the following specifics:

&lt;pre&gt;
Name: Debian
Type: Linux
Version: Debian
Memory size: (go with recommended memory size) / Next
Hard Drive: Create a virtual hard drive now / Create
Hard drive file type: VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) / Next
Storage on physical hard drive: Dynamically allocated / Next
File location and size: 50 GB / Create
&lt;/pre&gt;

Start the newly created virtual machine, select the ISO of Debian 7.4 stable (debian-7.4.0-i386-netinst.iso) and click Start.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

== VM Creation ==

It is recommended that you create a log of the build process by redirecting all the output to a log file. Be aware that by doing so no build progress will appear on the screen - instead a text log file will be created in your home folder. 


Build a Whonix-Gateway virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-gateway &gt;&gt; ~/log-gateway 2&gt;&amp;1
&lt;/pre&gt;


Build a Whonix-Workstation virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-workstation &gt;&gt; ~/log-workstation 2&gt;&amp;1
&lt;/pre&gt;

The resulting {{Code2|.ova}} images can be found in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} folder.


If don't want to create a log of the build process (the build progress will then appear on screen) use the following commands. 


'''This is not recommended because if anything goes wrong during the build, it will be harder to pinpoint the exact error without the actual log file.'''


For Workstation

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-workstation 
&lt;/pre&gt;

For Gateway

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./whonix_build --build --tor-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
'''OPTIONAL.'''

If you are interested in seeing a visual walk-through of the VM creation, click on Expand on the right.

&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;

Enter the Gateway build command

[[File:16b.png|400px]]


Provide sudo password

[[File:18b.png|400px]]
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

== VM image export == 

After a few hours (depending on your disk speed, CPU clock rate, available download bandwidth, ...) the image (either Workstation or Gateway) will be created in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} directory. This will take from 3 to 7 hours per image.

You need to export the OVA image and then [[Install  |use it in VirtualBox]].

To transfer the images you can use VirtualBox's Shared Folders Functionality or USB transfer.  

==== Export to a shared folder ====   

To use shared folder functionality you must have [[VirtualBox_Guest_Additions|Guest Additions]] installed.

Before installing Guest Additions read the [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html official manual page] and Whonix's [[VirtualBox_Guest_Additions|wiki page]].

If you still want to use it, [http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.6/ download the ISO] (VBoxGuestAdditions_4.3.6.iso) and set up folder as described in the manual.

==== Export via USB ====

Unless you install VirtualBox Extension Pack, USB 2.0 won't be supported. USB 1.1 transfer speed is very low, usually 0,5 - 1 MB/s.

===== Extension pack install (optional) =====
Before installing the extension pack read the [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#intro-installing official manual page].

To proceed, [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads download] the vbox file (Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.3.6-91406.vbox-extpack). Import the file in VirtualBox (File/Preferences/Extensions then locate the file). After installing, &quot;Oracle VM VirtualBOx Extension Pack&quot; entry will appear as &quot;Active&quot;, resulting in a green arrow icon in front of the name.

===== USB transfer=====
Make your USB key available to the VM through selecting it in the Devices/USB devices menu. Plug it in first of course ;)

You can automount your USB or set it up manually. The former involves typing up a long command but on some computers, usbmount might, for some reason, only reach speeds of USB 1.0, meaning it will take five to six hours to transfer the file. Test it out.

====== Using usbmount ====== 
&lt;pre&gt;
## Install usbmount that will automatically mount your USB to media/usb0
sudo apt-get install usbmount

## Check if the USB is present and mounted
cd /media/usb0

## Copy the OVA file to USB. 
sudo cp /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Workstation-7.7.9.8.ova /media/usb0

## or if you have been building the Gateway
sudo cp /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Gateway-7.7.9.8.ova /media/usb0

## Unmount the USB
sudo umount /media/usb0
&lt;/pre&gt;

Deselect your USB key in the VM's Devices/USB devices menu to make it available to your host system again.

====== Mounting USB manually ====== 
&lt;pre&gt;
## mount your USB key to /media/usb
sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/usb -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137

## Check if the USB is present and mounted
cd /media/usb

## Copy the OVA file to USB. 
sudo cp /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Workstation-7.7.9.8.ova /media/usb

## or if you have been building the Gateway
sudo cp /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Gateway-7.7.9.8.ova /media/usb

## Unmount the USB
sudo umount /media/usb
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Finishing up == 

You are done! OVA file is now on your USB key/in your shared folder. All you have to do is [[Install  |use it in VirtualBox]].

If you want to build another image (presuming you have build only Workstation or Gateway this time) revert the VM state to [[Jekyll:Sandbox#Building_from_source|Snapshot 2]].

From there follow the steps as you previously did and build the image you still need Workstation or Gateway.

Experimental:
The following AppArmor profile is still experimental. The worst thing that can happen is probably, that your application won't work, but since you can always remove the profile, no big deal. If you value your application data profiles, backup them beforehand.

Donating Whonix full time would require ~1300 $ (or in €, ~1000 €) per month. This might sound like a lot money. It's not. Germany is expensive. ~240 € per month for rent at the town's edge, ~350 € for compulsory health insurance, 30 € electricity, ~20 € internet flatrate, ~18 € compulsory public TV (gez, rundfunkbeitrag), food, clothes, transportation, whonix.org server cost... Isn't a lot money in comparison.

If you want to pay for getting a new feature, this may be possible as well, please get in [[Contact#For_private_inquiries|Contact]] to talk about the details.

Please get in [[Contact#For_Donations|Contact]] if you would like to donate but don't know how.

Donations aren't tax-deducible, because Whonix isn't a (non-profit) company yet.

To leave feedback, you could join the [https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,76.0.html Forum Discussion about Donations].</text>

Subject:

&lt;pre&gt;
Whonix Anonymous Operating System Version 8 Released!
&lt;/pre&gt;

Body:

&lt;pre&gt;
Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and
security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network, Debian GNU/Linux and
security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware
with root privileges can find out the user's real IP.

Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway,
which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other, which we call
Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only
connections through Tor are possible.

Download Whonix for VirtualBox
##############################

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Download

Download Whonxi for KVM / Qemu
##############################

Experimental. See below.

Users of Whonix 7 and below
###########################

There is no upgrade path from Whonix 7 to Whonix 8, sorry. You
have to manually download new Whonix images.

Call for Help
#############

- If you know shell scripting (/bin/bash) and linux sysadmin, please
join us! There are plenty of ways to make Whonix safer.
- We are also looking for a download mirros.
- For https://www.whonix.org we need some help with css, html,
mediawiki, wordpress, webdesign.

Download Whonix for KVM / Qemu
##############################

Entirely untested! This is only useful if you have a developers mindset!

This is the first time .qcow2 images are available (as .tar.gz, qcow2
image must be unpacked):
http://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/files/current/8/

We have unfinished(!) instructions for KVM:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM

There are still a few blockers before using Whonix with KVM can be
considered sane:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/KVM

Please help out solving them. Whonix also needs a maintainer to
support using Whonix with KVM.

If you want to upgrade existing Whonix version using Whonix's APT
repository
################################################################

Sorry, upgrading from existing Whonix version (0.5.6, 7, etc.) to Whonix
8 is not be possible.

Updating from the previous testers-only version 7.7.8.6 or 7.7.9.8
should be possible when you have Whonix's (stable) APT repository
enabled. See:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix-APT-Repository

(Whonix 7.7.9.8 is the same version as Whonix 8, just a different
version number.)

Changelog between Whonix 7 and Whonix 8
#######################################

* Whonix is now based on Debian stable instead of Debian testing.
* In new installations, automatic updates of Whonix's debian packages
are disabled by default. During first start, users can decide if they
want to enable Whonix's APT repository or want to leave it disabled.
* Fixed Whonix's Tor Browser download and start script for TBB 3.5.
* Fixed physical isolation build script.
* Verifiable Builds. Whonix now has a feature which allows the community
to check that Whonix .ova releases are verifiably created from project's
own source code. Also made ade Whonix's APT repository verifiable (even
deterministic!). Please see
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verifiable_Builds for details.
* Made Whonix build script configurable (can now build terminal-only
Whonix-Gateway's and/or Whonix-Workstations; 64 bit builds and more)
* Improved Whonix News's security. All Whonix News Files are now inside
one tarball, which is signed. This stops leaking how many users are
using a particular version.
* whonixcheck's Whonix News download now checks if Whonix News are still
valid (currently up to 4 weeks) and therefore detects indefinite freeze
and replay attacks.
* whonix_repository tool now has a graphical user interface; added more
command line switches.
* Set default locale to en_US.UTF-8.
* Simplified custom user installation of TorChat, thanks to dummytor.
(Protecting from Tor over Tor.)
* Removed apper and synaptic from default installation, because they are
too confusing / have too many bugs, do not always work in all cases for
all users, #104, can still be manually installed if wanted, see also
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Automatic_Updates
* whonixcheck: more configuration options, any function can now be
disabled, this is useful for users who wish to disable control port
filter proxy, they can disable the check_tor_bootstrap function
* whonixcheck: added protection against possibly malicious strings from
check.torproject.org (in case of a bug, compromise of check.tpo server
or CA compromise), IP strings are now max 50 characters long. User will
be warned in case the limit is exceeded.
* Whonix-Workstation: no longer installing Tor Browser by default, this
simplified implementing verifiable builds (#113), installing iceweasel
by default, which can be used to download Tor Browser, added local
iceweasel browser homepage saying that iceweasel should not be used for
anything other than downloading Tor Browser, unless one knows what one
is doing.
* Removed galternatives from whonix-workstation-default-applications
because galternatives has been (temporarily) removed from Debian testing
* Building Whonix from frozen repository, from snapshot.debian.org to
make the build script more resistant from upstream changes and also to
make Whonix verifiable.
* The Whonix Team can now use separate keys for Whonix's APT Repository
and Whonix News.
* Added technical documentation about keys in Whonix
whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/keys/readme.
* new man page: man/whonix_shared/sdwdate.8.ronn
* Deactivated Maximizing Windows by dragging them to the top of the
screen to prevent users from accidentally maximizing their browser
window when they are using resolutions higher than 1024x768. See
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Higher_Screen_Resolution ;
https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/110 and
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7255 for more
information. #108
* added udisks to whonix-shared-packages-recommended for mounting
removable drives
* KDE settings changes, set to oxygen as suggested by scarp in
&quot;[Whonix-devel] Plastique kwin style &amp; Widget Style&quot;
* whonixcheck: increased timeout for the tor bootstrap.py utility from 5
to 10 seconds to make it compatible with slow systems as per bug
reporthttps://www.whonix.org/wiki/Special:AWCforum/st/id248/whonixcheck%3A_tor_bootstrap_statu....html
* whonixcheck: Whonix News File is now deterministic
* whonixcheck: Whonix News added timeout for gpg and tar
* added secure-delete, because it contains sfill, which can be used to
zero out free space, which is required for disk shrinking
* Deactivated running update-command-not-found during build, since not
deterministic (verifiable). Manually running is of course still possible.
* whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list: removed the &quot;deb
http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-0.2.4.x-jessie main&quot;
repository, since that repository has been removed by The Tor Project
(Tor is now in their Debian testing repository, which is already added)
* fixed a bug reported by scarp,
whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_disable_kdm_autostart: was
not disabling other display managers other than kdm. Now using the more
generic /usr/lib/whonix/display-manager-dpkg-post-invoke.
* msgcollector: fix race condition not always closing progress bar when
it reached 100%
* Whonix-Gateway: Workaround for
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=732578
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Download#Connection_Issues_-_Tor_stops_working_after_an_Upgrade_and_needs_a_Workaround
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Special:AWCforum/st/id287/new_tor_and_debian_updates_today....html
Set in /etc/default/tor:
USE_AA_EXEC=&quot;no&quot; Can be commented out when that bug gets fixed.
* optionally (opt-in) building qcow2 images, first rudimentary
implementation, build target (VirtualBox or qcow2 or both) should
probably be configurable in whonix_build script (#122)
* Whonix News Blog Download / Whonix News: Whonix News Blogs (Whonix
Feature Blog and Whonix Important Blog) are now deployed over the same
mechanism as Whonix News.
* Whonix-Workstation: better implementation of dummytor using
config-package-dev (might break compatibility with Whonix 7)
* removed adrelanos' old key; removed
whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_legacy (breaks
compatiblity with Whonix 7)
* Re-implemented uwt and dummytor using config-package-dev instead of
custom dpkg-diversions. Breaks compatibly with Whonix 7.
* Removed rawdog and pandoc since no longer required.
* moved misc scripts (Scripts for managing Whonix's offical repository
and Whonix News; debug scripts; developer documentation and deprecated
code) to https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files
* whonixcheck: do not show output of gpg for Whonix News verification
* whonixcheck: do not start whonixcheck, if whonixsetup hasn't
finished yet
* whonixcheck: new --verbose / --debug options
* whonixcheck: Check that /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward and
/proc/sys/net/ipv6/ip_forward aren't set to 1 to prevent users from
shooting their own feet.
* whonixcheck: Whonix News can now optionally be signed with two keys,
as long as either one is still valid, will be accepted
* whonixcheck: whonix_shared/etc/init.d/whonixcheckd: on stop, give
whonixcheck time to gracefully shut down so it can close any still
eventually open progress bars
* whonixcheck: fix, exit cleanly (close progress bar) when killed by
other instance of whonixcheck
* whonixsetup: start whonixcheck at the end of whonixsetup on
Whonix-Workstation
* torbrowser: hide output of gpg import; ask &quot;Start Tor Browser yes/no&quot;
after upgrading&quot;
* torbrowser: added timeout to gpg to prevent endless data attacks
* torbrowser/whonixcheck: alternative method detecting locally installed
Tor Browser version. When $tbb_folder/Docs/version does not exist, i.e.
when the user manually downloaded Tor Browser, try to detect version
number from ~/tor-browser_en-US/Docs/sources/versions.; comment
* desktop: higher resolution icons for whonix_repository, whonixcheck,
contribute and donate, whonix gateway firewall, tb recommend, important
blog and torbrowser
* ram adjusted desktop starter: fixed lightdm (/usr/sbin/...) auto
detection
* qcow2 images: added metadata preallocation
* qcow2 images: added &quot;-o cluster_size=2M&quot; to &quot;qemu-img&quot; for better
performance
* build script: fix &quot;sudo: unable to resolve host debian&quot;
* build script: added --no-options to gpg to avoid conflict with user's
gpg config files
* build script: added benchmarking
* build script: whonix_build_both: support extra parameter
* build script: got rid of grml_config by using grml-debootstrap's new
environment variables feature
* build script: skip backup-img-after-grml-debootstrap and
backup-img-after-meta-package-install build steps by default, can be
re-enabled by builder
* build script: allow running build-steps.d/2400_convert-img-to-qcow2
without root
* build script: improved error handling, when error is detected, wait
until builder presses enter before cleanup and exit to make it simpler
to read error messages when building in cli
* build script: fixed update-locale bug
build script: Avoiding &quot;perl: warning: Setting locale failed.&quot; as
suggested on     https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot and
https://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64/2005/08/msg00249.html by setting
    export LANG=&quot;C&quot;
* verifiable builds: new build step build-steps.d/2350_cleanup; Get rid
of /dev folder inside the vm image. This is only required for verifiable
builds. Otherwise this could be skipped. For example, &quot;sudo
sha512sum /dev/xconsole&quot; or &quot;sudo sha512sum /dev/initctl&quot; would run
forever. The /dev folder gets recreated by the kernel upon first boot.
* Improved messages.
* Lots of smaller fixes.
* Code refactoring.
* For more details, see the git log.

|description=Instructions on how to set up a Whonix Download Mirror
}}

If you would like to use alternative end-to-end encryption (independent from [[SSL]] certificate authorities), be independent from the mainstream domain name system or want to reduce your load on Tor's exit nodes, browsing this wiki (and our [https://www.whonix.org/forum forums] and [https://www.whonix.org/blog blog]) using our .onion address is easy and seamless, once configured. 

== Requirements ==

* Tor Browser Bundle (If you're using Whonix, you already have this.)

== Background ==

HTTPS Everywhere is a very clever tool created by folks at the [https://www.eff.org EFF] to automatically take you from browsing HTTP (insecure) versions of popular websites to the HTTPS (more secure) version, if that particular website offers it. However, HTTPS Everywhere supports user rules, and it is not limited to HTTP(S), so you can configure it to take you to our .onion instead of our .org!

== Adding the user rule ==

Locate the directory &quot;HTTPSEverywhereUserRules&quot;, it should be /home/user/tor-browser_en-US/Data/Browser/profile.default/HTTPSEverywhereUserRules or somewhere close to that. 

Create a new file called WhonixOnion.xml paste:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;ruleset name=&quot;Whonix Onion&quot;&gt;
  &lt;target host=&quot;www.whonix.org&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;target host=&quot;kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;rule from=&quot;^http(s)?://(www\.)?whonix\.org/&quot; to=&quot;http://kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion/&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/ruleset&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
and save.

== (re)Start your browser ==

After installing the user rule, start or restart your Tor browser. When you browse out to www.whonix.org, HTTPS Everywhere will automatically engage, and send you to kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion. If you want to disable this functionality, disable the ruleset using the HTTPS Everywhere icon in the upper right of the browser window, or simply delete the file.

Happy browsing!

Open Source does not automagically prevent [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_%28computing%29 backdoors], unless the user creates its own binaries from source code itself. The ones who compile, upload and distribute (also the webhost) the binaries could add a {{Code2|hidden code}} without publishing the backdoor code. Nothing prevents one to claim, that a certain binary has been built from a clean source code, while the binary was actually built by the source code plus the backdoor code. Also the ones who may have infected the build machine with a backdoor are in position to add a backdoor without the distributor being aware of it.

Deterministic builds can detect backdoors. For more information on deterministic builds and why this is important, see:

A [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing) backdoor] can either be a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing) vulnerability] as in a bug in the source code. Vulnerabilities can get introduced by accident (human error) or on purpose. Once the software has been deployed and the vulnerability has been found, it might happen, that an attacker uses an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security) exploits] to gain unauthorized access. [http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/42318/hiding-backdoors-in-open-source-code-in-other-languages-than-c-and-c Such vulnerabilities (or purposely planted backdoors) can, with cleverness, be planted in Open Source code plain sight, while being very difficult and unlikely to be spotted by people looking at the code.] Examples:

* [https://lwn.net/Articles/57135/ An attempt to backdoor the kernel].
* Some argued, the [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/21/massive_debian_openssl_hangover/ Debian SSL debacle], wasn't a bug, but a backdoor (no one has spot vulnerability in the source code for years!).

Another form of a backdoor is adding the full code (or binary) of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing) trojan horse] (computer virus) to the binary build, while not publishing the extra source code and keeping that secret code. The latter, can only be detected with {{Code2|Deterministic Builds}}, which are discussed above.
&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore it is impossible to claim that non-trivial source code is backdoor free, because a backdoors can be hidden as vulnerabilities. Auditors scrutinizing the source code can only state their opinion about the quality of the source code and eventually report a vulnerability. It can only be reasonably easily checked, if the source code is free of computer viruses (for example, trojan horses), not backdoors.

Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en&lt;/ref&gt;, Debian GNU/Linux&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian&lt;/ref&gt; and security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP.

Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.

To learn more about security and anonymity under Whonix, please continue to the [[About|About Whonix]] page.

'''UNFINISHED!''' &lt;br /&gt;
'''UNTESTED!'''

(Iceweasel is required, because Tor Browser no longer supports visiting 127.0.0.1. Any other browser would work as well.)

Install web software.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install git apache2 php5-mysql php5 libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-client mysql-server iceweasel
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will be asked for a mysql root password. Remember it.

Get our wiki images and content database backup.

&lt;pre&gt;
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/WhonixBOT/WhonixWikiBackups.git
&lt;/pre&gt;

Get and install the mediawiki web app.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo su
cd /var/www
wget http://releases.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.22/mediawiki-1.22.3.tar.gz
tar -xvzf mediawiki-1.22.3.tar.gz
mv mediawiki-1.22.3 wiki
&lt;/pre&gt;

Start iceweasel.

Setup mediawiki. Go to http://127.0.0.1/wiki/mw-config/index.php.

Use the following settings.

&lt;pre&gt;
Database name: wiki
Datebase password: what you remembered above
No more questions.
Otherwise use the defaults.
Name of wiki:
Whonix
&lt;/pre&gt;

Download LocalSettings.php, safe as /home/user/LocalSettings.php.

&lt;pre&gt;
cd wiki
cp /home/user/LocalSettings.php /var/www/wiki/
php maintenance/importDump.php /home/user/WhonixWikiBackups/dumpContentCurrent.xml
php maintenance/update.php
php maintenance/importImages.php /home/user/WhonixWikiBackups/mediafiles/
&lt;/pre&gt;

Go to http://127.0.0.1/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.

|description=Complete and Comprehensive Instructions to build Whonix 9 Virtual Machine Images from Source Code. Including build configurations, such as 64 bit builds, Terminal-Only builds and so forth.
}}
{{forkme}}

| image      = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px|alt=&lt;translate&gt;Whonix 9 is still under development warning&lt;/translate&gt;]]
| text       = Whonix 9 is still under development. See [[Dev/Build Documentation]] to find links to the stable version.
}}

= Build Documentation =
== Introduction ==
This page documents how to build Whonix VirtualBox images. If you have any questions or need help, get in Contact.

It documents how to build the '''testers-only version''' of Whonix. Rather, if you are interested in building the stable version of Whonix, click [[Dev/Build_Documentation|Build Documentation]].

Knowledge assumed: basic principles of Virtualization; operation of your platform; Linux knowledge: how to install Debian and basic command line knowledge.

Only one prerequisite: you need a working internet connection.

For discussion related to the development and build process of Whonix images get
in contact.

How to use the resulting images, is documented in the [[Documentation]].

== Warning ==
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Don't add private files to Whonix's source code folder!'''
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': Technically, it would work. Everything in whonix_gateway folder will get installed on Whonix-Gateway, whonix_workstation folder respectively, whonix_shared folder goes to both Whonix machines. This is recommended against. Those files would get managed by either the whonix-gateway-files, whonix-workstation-files or the whonix-shared-files package. When you later update Whonix debian packages, your files would get deleted by the package manager. Also adding private files to Whonix's source code folder, later contributing to Whonix's development and accidentally pushing the wrong git branch would be a disaster. Better add your private files to Whonix after building Whonix. Or add a custom build step adding your files, which then get copied from a folder outside of Whonix's source folder.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Gnome user? Please disable device auto mounter and the file indexing service. You can do this by running the following commands.''' (If you don't know if you are a Gnome user or not, just run this command, it won't hurt.)
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': &lt;ref&gt;Otherwise a file manager may open Whonix's chroot folder (the directory, in which the image which is currently build is mounted) while building Whonix which could lead to failing umount because the device is still busy.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Run the following command.
&lt;pre&gt;
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open false
&lt;/pre&gt;
* System Tools -&gt; Settings -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Details -&gt; Removable Media -&gt; Uncheck &quot;Never prompt or start programs on media insertion&quot;
* System Tools -&gt; Settings -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Search and Indexing -&gt; Uncheck &quot;Monitor file and directory changes&quot;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''KDE user? It is recommended to disable nepomuk.You can do this by running the following command.'''
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': &lt;ref&gt;Nepomuk indexing the whonix_binary folder wastes some time indexing.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Start menu -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Desktop Search -&gt; uncheck Enable Nepomuk Sematic Desktop -&gt; Apply
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Make sure there aren't any VMs in VirtualBox already called Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation!''' 
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': &lt;ref&gt;Because the build script would fail, because it tries to create VMs either named Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Check if the [[Dev/SourceCodeIntro#OpenPGP Keys|OpenPGP public keys]] are still up to date. If you are in luck, you never have to update the keys yourself and the Whonix maintainer will keep them updated.''' 
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': For better security.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Short'''&lt;/u&gt;: '''Do not try to build Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation at the same time!'''
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
''Long'': Building Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation at the same time is not supported due to limitations in the build script. In other words, do not try to run {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-gateway}} and {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-workstation}} at the same time. The build would probably fail.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Build Anonymity ==
While downloading the required tools for building Whonix your internet service provider could if he want notice that you want to build Whonix. This is especially interesting, if you want to redistribute Whonix, but still want to stay anonymous. The full story can be read in the chapter [[Build Anonymity]].

== Build Security ==
Especially, but not exclusively, if you want to distribute Whonix images, you should improve the security of your build environment.

* Build on a dedicated build system, install security updates... ([[Security Guide]])
* All installation medium&lt;ref&gt;Such as DVD or USB.&lt;/ref&gt; and all downloaded/used code must be verified (including all software on the host).
* Hashes, fingerprints in the scripts and the wiki is not to be trusted. Verify everything.
* Read [[Trust]].

== Host Preparation ==
&lt;!--
EDITORS NOTE: The following host preparation text is duplicated on 3 pages.
(1) [[Physical Isolation]]
(2) [[Dev/Build Documentation]] for VM images
(3) Whonix debian packages.
When making changes here, please consider also making changes there.
(Not using a template, because it would probably require a version specific template.)
--&gt;
* You need to build on '''Debian &lt;u&gt;stable&lt;/u&gt; (currently: wheezy)'''. (How to obtain Debian safely: &lt;ref&gt;[[Debian|Debian ISO OpenPGP verification]]&lt;/ref&gt;) &lt;ref&gt;The build scripts could be adapted to run on other {{Code2|*NIX}} systems as well but currently they assume {{Code2|apt-get}} and {{Code2|grml-debootstrap}} to be available.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Build dependencies and configurations get automatically applied, so you don't have to worry about that. &lt;ref&gt;By {{Code2|[https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine]}}.))&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is recommended to set your terminal (for example Konsole) to unlimited scrollback, so you can watch the full build log.
* You need ~ 30 GB free disk space. When you build inside a Virtual Machine using sparse files such as VirtualBox, consider assigning 100 GB free space. (Sparse files will grow as space is actually used. Won't take up space if it's not used. Easier to have the option to use more space than growing the image later.) More info: &lt;ref&gt;~ 25 GB might suffice as well. We haven't messured that in detail yet. Less space required, if you only want to build either Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation. Less space for Whonix-Gateway required than for Whonix-Workstation.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building Whonix in Whonix ==
&lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:800px&quot;&gt;
'''You only have to read this, if you want to build Whonix in Whonix.''' &lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested, click on Expand on the right.
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;

'''TODO''': Currently probably not possible, because there is no existing Whonix release based on Debian stable (currently: wheezy).

Building Whonix in Whonix is possible as well (if the Whonix version you are using as host is also based on Debian stable (currently: wheezy)). Unfortunately, apt-cacher-ng does not like Whonix's apt repository on sourceforge.net. Adrelanos already reported a bug. As long as this bug isn't fixed, you need to disable Whonix's apt repository while building Whonix. You can do this using the {{Code2|whonix_repository}} tool.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo whonix_repository --disable
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

== Introduction into Whonix Source Code ==
'''If you prefer to read and understand the source code just by reading scripts you may skip this optional chapter.'''

When you like to mess with the source code, it would probably help a lot if you at least know what {{Code|.img}}, {{Code|.vdi}}, {{Code|.vmdk}} and {{Code|.ova}} are being used for. See [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro|Source Code Introduction]].

== Preparation Steps ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

See [[Dev/Redistribution#Pre_Building|Redistribution Pre Building]].

{{Build_Documentation_Get_Source_Code}}

{{Build_Configuration}}

== VM Creation ==
&lt;!--
EDITORS NOTE:
I am not sure it is a great idea to first tell builders how to build Whonix and later how to clean up to prepare for another build. Running the cleanup steps before the creation steps may be unnecessary when running these steps for the first time, but doesn't hurt either. An important thing this does archive is creating fewer support requests and bug reports from people running these steps for the second time without remembering they have to clean up first. If you want to discuss this, please open a new discussion.
--&gt;

Open a terminal (such as Konsole).

Delete eventually already existing Whonix-Gateway virtual machine. '''Warning''': This will delete a virtual machine named Whonix-Gateway from Virtual Box!

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --clean --tor-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

Delete eventually already existing Whonix-Workstation virtual machine. '''Warning''': This will delete a virtual machine named Whonix-Workstation from Virtual Box!

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --clean --tor-workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

From now, you have two options. If you do not wish to use different build configurations for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation (for example, if you do not wish to create a terminal-only Whonix-Gateway and a full Whonix-Workstation), you could use the {{Code|sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build_both}} wrapper script to build both virtual machines at once. If you wish to use different build configurations, you must use the {{Code2|whonix_build}} script to build one after the other as described below.

Build a Whonix-Gateway virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

Eventually, if you wish to use a different build configuration for Whonix-Workstation, change the contents in your {{Code2|/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d}} folder.

Build a Whonix-Workstation virtual machine image.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --build --tor-workstation
&lt;/pre&gt;

The resulting {{Code2|.ova}} images can be found in {{Code|~/whonix_binary}} folder.

While building, you might see a few [[#Expected Build Warnings|Expected Build Warnings]].

Check if all went ok.

Please report back any issues!

== Build Verification (Optional) ==
{{Build Documentation Build Verification}}

== Cleanup ==
{{Build_Documentation_Cleanup}}

== Debugging ==
'''OPTIONAL''' (Only in case something goes wrong or if you want to audit or develop Whonix.)

See [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Debugging|Debugging]].

== Final Steps ==
'''Only required if you want to redistribute (official) Whonix builds.'''

= Expected Build Warnings =
&lt;pre&gt;
Can not write log, openpty() failed (/dev/pts not mounted?)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Does not affect the build. &lt;ref&gt;Nothing to worry about. Only happens because we are running commands inside chroot. If you research this &quot;issue&quot;, you'll read that it is purely cosmetic.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
[....] Your system does not have the CPU extensions required to use KVM. Not doing anything. ...[ FAIL ]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Does not affect the build. &lt;ref&gt;KVM gets installed as dependency of our build dependency libguestfs-tools. We don't need KVM for building the actual images.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
[....] Stopping VirtualBox kernel modules [ ok ].
[....] Starting VirtualBox kernel modules[....] No suitable module for running kernel found ...[ FAIL ]
invoke-rc.d: initscript virtualbox, action &quot;restart&quot; failed.
&lt;/pre&gt;
Does not affect the build. &lt;ref&gt;Only means, that VirtualBox can not be started. VirtualBox kernel modules could not be complied, because the {{Code|linux-headers-$(uname -r)}} package was not installed prior installing VirtualBox (prior starting Whonix's build script). The build script doesn't start VirtualBox, hence does not affect the build. The build script only uses {{Code|VBoxManage}} for creation of virtual machine description files and that tool doesn't need VirtualBox kernel modules.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
WARNING: The character device /dev/vboxdrv does not exist.
	 Please install the virtualbox-ose-dkms package and the appropriate
	 headers, most likely linux-headers-486.

	 You will not be able to start VMs until this problem is fixed.
&lt;/pre&gt;
Does not affect the build. &lt;ref&gt;Same as above.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
dpkg: warning: failed to open configuration file '/root/.dpkg.cfg' for reading: Permission denied
&lt;/pre&gt;
Does not affect the build. &lt;ref&gt;This happens because we are running {{Code|debuild}} as user, not root. Probably a bug in dpkg. If you research this, you'll see, there were many such bugs in dpkg.&lt;/ref&gt;
